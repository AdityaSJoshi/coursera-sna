1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,534
Even though it may not have seemed that
way, so far we've only considered simple

2
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:10,536
contagion.
And by simple I mean that if one of my

3
00:00:10,536 --> 00:00:14,877
friends is infected,
That's enough for me to become infected as

4
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:17,396
well.
Of course there are parameters, the

5
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:22,559
probability per time period that my friend
infects me, whether they'll recover before

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,911
they have a chance to infect me, etcetera.
But the main thing that makes it simple is

7
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:30,934
that it's just between me and one of my
friends.

8
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:35,656
And this makes sense for things such as
viruses that are diffusing or even

9
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:40,001
information that's diffusing.
It's enough for one person to tall me a

10
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:45,023
piece of information and then I know it.
On the other hand, there're other

11
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:48,513
processes,
For example, the adoption of certain

12
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:54,051
behaviors or the, the making of purchases,
where you may want to consider what

13
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:59,817
multiple of your friends are doing.
So, for example, say I'm an impressionable

14
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:05,280
teenager in high school and I, I see one
of my friends wearing red pants.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,024
I'm not going to run out and buy red pants
just because one of my friends did.

16
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:16,916
I want to make sure that several of my
friends are wearing red pants before I'm

17
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:22,808
really convinced that that's the cool
thing to do, and then I'll go ahead and do

18
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:26,048
it.
And as you might imagine, this has rather

19
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:31,793
different dynamics, so let's go back to
that small world topology and see what

20
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,300
that does.
So, here I am in that logo.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,886
I have created a slightly smaller network
so we can better see what's going on.

22
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:45,471
And what we're going to do, is we're going
to do this complex contagion process on

23
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:50,579
top of the network, where the rules are
that a node will look around to its

24
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,233
neighbors and it will adopt the behavior,
that is, it'll become yellow if it decides

25
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,723
to buy.
Red pants, and it will do so only if at

26
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:03,510
least two of its friends have done this
already.

27
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,924
So to begin with we are going to infect
two neighboring nodes, because unless we

28
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:16,416
do this the, the infection is kind of dead
from the get go, so no one is going to buy

29
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:22,753
red pants if only one node in the network
has fought red pants, according to these

30
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:26,702
rules.
And now, we're going to allow this, you

31
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:32,606
know, red pant crazed spread.
I'm going to reinfect a few times, just so

32
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:38,510
you can see what's going on.
And I'd like you to pay attention to both

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,752
what is the structure like, where the
infection is stopped, and also, is the

34
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:51,246
infection successfully using the short
range ties, I mean, the long range ties,

35
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,052
So we can, and let this run a little bit
and hopefully this is enough information,

36
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:04,832
otherwise, you're very welcome to play
with the model yourself.

37
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,061
So, here is our question,
Relative to the simple contagion process,

38
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:14,890
the complex contagion process, is it
better able to use shortcuts, does it

39
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,983
advance more rapidly through the network,
and does it infect a greater number of

40
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:25,139
nodes?
Complex contagion, even though it has the

41
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,127
name complex, has.
In this case, it had a very simple rule,

42
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:34,315
that is, it was a threshold model, and the
threshold was just in terms of the number

43
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:37,752
of your neighbors that have adopted a
certain behavior.

44
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:42,627
However, sometimes what you're really
playing is a coordination game, where you

45
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:46,877
have two different choices and you're
trying to decide between them.

46
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:51,440
And as I said in the previous segment,
this could be, for example, deciding

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,002
between different chat, online chat
clients, and it depends on how many of

48
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,690
your friends are using each of them.
So it's not that two friends are using it,

49
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:07,268
but, are more friends using one versus the
other. And also importantly how good or

50
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:13,060
those, those chat clients, so let's switch
the context a bit and say we're still

51
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,310
choosing between two things, and let's
just call them basketball and soccer.

52
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,760
And,
If a friend chooses to play basketball, as

53
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,097
well, so they're making choice A,
I will get payoff A every time, for each

54
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:35,290
friend. And if my friends choose B then I
will get payoff B.

55
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:41,195
And, if, you know, I just have one friend
and they choose the opposite of what I

56
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:46,444
chose then my payoff is zero, right?
I get no enjoyment if I want to play

57
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:52,130
soccer and I can't play on my own and my
friend only wants to play basketball.

58
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,161
So let's see how this plays out.
This note in the middle is trying to

59
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:03,742
decide between playing basketball,
Which three of his friends play basketball

60
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:06,878
or playing soccer.
Two of his friends play soccer,

61
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:11,615
But that's not the only variable, right.
And so sure, three-fifths of his network

62
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:15,026
is basketball, and two-fifths of his
network is soccer.

63
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:19,700
But there's also the question of which one
of these sports he enjoys more?

64
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,247
So how, is he going to do this, this
calculation deciding between the two

65
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,942
sports.
Well, this is the formulation.

66
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:32,768
He has d neighbors or d friends and a
fraction p of them are going to play

67
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:37,195
basketball.
This is the three-fifths and one - p, p

68
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:42,236
fraction of them are going to play soccer.
This is the two-fifths.

69
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:48,613
And if he chooses to play basketball, his
payoff is the number of his friends who

70
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:55,168
are playing basketball, which is just p 
d  a, which is the payoff he gets per

71
00:05:55,168 --> 00:06:00,333
each friend who plays basketball.
Similarly for soccer, the payoff, if you,

72
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:05,928
if you are to choose to play soccer, the
payoff would be 1-p<i>d, that's the number</i>

73
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:11,308
of friends who are playing soccer,  b,
the payoff he gets or the enjoyment he

74
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:14,392
gets from playing soccer with each of
them.

75
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:19,485
So, this means that he should choose a if
pd<i>a </i> d  a is greater than or equal to

76
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:21,637
1d<i>b.
</i> p  d  b, this, you know, payoff from

77
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:28,107
soccer and payoff from basketball, and you
can reformulate this so that it's, he will

78
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:34,992
be playing basketball if the proportion of
his friends playing basketball is greater

79
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:38,961
than or equal to b, which is the payoff
for soccer / ab.

80
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:42,930
+ b, kind of the sum of the payoffs for
either choice.

81
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,039
And there are two equilibria in this
problem.

82
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,982
The first is that everyone decides to play
basketball and what an equilibria means is

83
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:57,303
that no individual, given the current
situation, would want to switch, right?

84
00:06:57,303 --> 00:07:02,832
Because if everyone's playing basketball,
you would get zero payoff from playing

85
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:08,291
soccer because you, there are no other
soccer players, so it's just not possible.

86
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:13,474
You get to have zero from each of your
friends because they're all playing

87
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:17,308
basketball.
Similarly, everyone could decide to play

88
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:23,510
soccer, in which case no single individual
would choose to play basketball instead.

89
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,045
But what happens in between, right?
You have these equilibria, which is that

90
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:34,431
everyone's just doing one thing.
But, what if, for some reason, you had two

91
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:38,994
of the nodes switched,
There could be some external reason.

92
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:44,380
So, let's see a particular example.
Let's say that, the payoff for playing

93
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,589
basketball with a friend is three, and the
playoff for playing soccer with a friend

94
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:57,316
is two and we have the, the payoff, that
means that the payoff for nodes who are

95
00:07:57,316 --> 00:08:03,885
both playing basketball is three halves as
large as what they get if they both choose

96
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:08,009
to play soccer.
So they get like, a 50%, you know, greater

97
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,293
payoff.
And, this also means that nodes will

98
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:17,983
switch from soccer to basketball, if at
least two-fifths of their friends are, you

99
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:21,937
know, not using a, or, or, or, are playing
basketball.

100
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:29,292
So it means you know it can be a minority,
it can be two-fifths of your friends were

101
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:34,433
playing, so much more appealing than
soccer that you will switch once you pass

102
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:39,612
that threshold.
So let's see how this cascade might occur.

103
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:47,596
Suppose you have some devious company that
comes and says we'll give you free shoes.

104
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:54,250
You know, named branded with some
basketball player's name if you play

105
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:01,854
basketball and you don't play soccer.
And so, these two nodes then start playing

106
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:06,411
basketball.
Now, this node is looking and it's finding

107
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:12,013
that half of its friends, so two out of
four, are playing basketball,

108
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:19,371
And since the threshold for switching over
is two-fifths, now this node as well is

109
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:24,286
playing basketball.
Now the quiz question is, can you figure

110
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:29,525
out which node or nodes will switch to
playing basketball next?

111
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:35,680
Is it going to be just A, just B, just C,
Or some combination of these three?

112
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,185
Okay.
Hopefully, you figured out that it was B

113
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:44,980
who would switch next,
Because it was looking at its four

114
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:51,289
neighbors, two of whom had switched
versus, at that point, you know,if you, if

115
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:56,477
you exclude B,
A was looking at three neighbors, only one

116
00:09:56,477 --> 00:10:01,517
of which had switched to basketball.
And so that's, that's 1/3,.

117
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:07,523
Which is less than, than two-fifths.
So, it wasn't sufficient to flip either A

118
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:13,149
or C was in a symmetric situation.
But now that B has flipped, both A and C

119
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,722
also find it favorable to switch to
basketball.

120
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:21,360
And so, what you just saw was a cascade
going through the network,

121
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,455
Even though it just started with two nodes
changing their minds or having their minds

122
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,849
changed for them,
And then everyone goes ahead and switches

123
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:35,817
to basketball,
Which presumably is good, because it seems

124
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:41,487
like the payoff for basketball in this,
you know, fake scenario is higher than it

125
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:46,231
is for soccer.
There's a NetLogo app, which you will be

126
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:50,640
exploring a little bit more in your
assignment,

127
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:55,048
That allows you to try different
topologies,

128
00:10:55,048 --> 00:11:02,530
And what you'll be doing is allocating an
initial opinion, but your nodes are going

129
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,952
to be flipping, a biased coin deciding.
Actually, I think it's an unbiased coin.

130
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:14,453
So, 50/50, whether they are red or they're
blue and then you can update their opinion

131
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:21,075
according to these rules and these
payoffs, they can try this several times

132
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:28,225
just to see how the structure plays out as
to what the stable configuration is.

133
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:35,200
That is nodes, individual node would like
to switch given their current payoffs.

134
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,684
There are of course, implications for
viral marketing.

135
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:50,921
If you really can influence some subset of
the nodes, whether by paying them off or

136
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:57,810
giving them a free product samples, which
individuals would you want to pick?

137
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,845
And so using the same,
App, you can kind of take turns, if you

138
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:09,979
find someone to play this with,
Otherwise, you can kind of play against

139
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:15,412
yourself if you like.
So you can take turns selecting which

140
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:20,320
nodes you initially infect, and then you
can see how the,

141
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:27,063
What the payoff is as far as how many
individuals eventually adopt your,

142
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:30,209
product,
Whether its red or blue.

143
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,075
So you would select blue and say I want
to,

144
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:39,650
Well, now it's red's turn,
And red says, well I want to be right

145
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,864
here, and blue might pick here.
Oh, sorry, we did another red.

146
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,752
No matter.
[laugh].

147
00:12:46,752 --> 00:12:53,811
And here is blue and now we can do
successive updates and just see how things

148
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:58,720
play out.
In this case, poor red did not choose very

149
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,993
wisely.
So, the question is, you know, what is the

150
00:13:02,993 --> 00:13:10,357
stable set of traces and how might you
optimally select your initial set such

151
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,630
that you would maximize your influence
within a number.

152
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,561
So, having seen several of these
demonstrations, let's see if you've built

153
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:23,534
up enough intuition to answer the
following.

154
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:27,115
What is the role of communities in complex
contagion?

155
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:32,452
Do they enable ideas to spread in the
presence of thresholds or do they create

156
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:37,587
isolated pockets of nodes within the
network that are impervious to outside

157
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:40,627
ideas?
Or, do they allow different opinions to

158
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:43,600
take hold in different parts of the
network?

159
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,083
Hopefully, you realized that they actually
do all three.

160
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:54,289
In the first case, complex contagion means
that you need to observe multiple of your

161
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:00,421
neighbors doing some action, or that you
are going to decide based on your fraction

162
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:05,150
of your network that is doing one thing as
opposed to the other.

163
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,987
And for this community structure is very
crucial, because it provides the dense

164
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:16,707
linking around the ego that is the node,
that allows them to observe similar

165
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:22,261
behavior among their friends.
Similarly, though, it can create isolated

166
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:28,158
pockets of nodes who are holding on to one
opinion or one way of doing things,

167
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:34,311
because they are seeing that where most of
the friends within the community are doing

168
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:40,111
something one way, and it would just be
too inefficient or too costly to switch to

169
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:44,001
something that someone is bringing in from
the outside.

170
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:49,094
So on the one hand, it facilitates
adaption with in the community but, it

171
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:54,470
makes it hard for new things to come in to
the community in the first place.

172
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,584
It also then consequencely, consequently
allows different opinions to take hold in

173
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:05,804
different parts of the network.
Because each community may independent,

174
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:11,620
not independently, but they may, it may
seem as if those they independently can

175
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,391
hold onto their beliefs.
One last wrinkle that I would like to

176
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:23,137
introduce and this you can read about in
the Easley/Kleinberg Chapter nineteen, is

177
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:28,080
that of bilingual nodes.
Now, what are you, what are you talking

178
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,630
about? What are
We haven't been talking about languages?

179
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,585
Well, in this case, it might mean if you,
actually, are bi sporty.

180
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:41,885
[laugh] That is you play basketball and
you play soccer.

181
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:47,716
Well, that's great, then you can play with
everyone who plays basketball and with

182
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:52,381
everyone who plays soccer.
However, typically in these situations,

183
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:56,316
there's some cost.
So, besides the actual cost of maybe

184
00:15:56,316 --> 00:16:02,293
needing a pair of cleats for soccer and a
pair of basketball shoes for basketball,

185
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:08,237
Perhaps the cost is your time. You simply
have to spend more time playing both

186
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:14,086
sports, and you may not get as good as,
you know, if you weren't splitting your

187
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:19,784
time between the two activities.
So in this case being bilingual comes with

188
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:23,582
a cost.
Similarly, the earlier example of instant

189
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,793
messaging clients.
You know, just having the overhead of

190
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:33,268
having two messaging clients open or
setting up a single messaging client to

191
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:38,457
talk with two different services, and
then, you know, having to manage your

192
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,581
identity on two different clients as well
can be a hassle,

193
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:45,709
Right?
So there's some cost, but, you may very

194
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:51,468
well be willing to pay that cost because
it means that you can now interact with

195
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:56,018
more parts of your network.
Even though they may have the making

196
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:59,805
different decisions,
So let's try this on the line.

197
00:16:59,805 --> 00:17:05,563
So, switching back over to NetLogo.
I'm going to first of all, I'm going to

198
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:10,216
turn off bilingual,
And I'm going to, well, this, this is what

199
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:16,682
you might foresee when you do set up line.
But if you just lay out, you'll see that

200
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:22,597
it's a nice ring lattice in fact.
And we can allocate the opinion at random

201
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:26,935
and then we can update,
So just observe what's going on.

202
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:29,380
We allocate again, right?
And so,

203
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:34,231
Great,
So we have A is the payoff for playing

204
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:41,913
blue, and in this case the payoff for blue
is higher than the payoff for red.

205
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:49,644
Now, I'm going to turn on bilingual,
Which means a node can choose to be able

206
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:55,323
to interact with both the red and blue,
however it will have to be this additional

207
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:58,925
cost of two.
So, I am going to allocate the opinion and

208
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:04,812
then I am going to update and you can see
several bilingual nodes cropping up where

209
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:10,700
they would like to talk to someone who is
red and someone who is blue and now we can

210
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,098
keep updating.
So, let's just do that again,

211
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:18,088
So we have initially nodes using red and
blue.

212
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:22,338
Now, we update.
So see if you can answer this quiz

213
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:27,183
question, which is, what is the presence
of the bilingual node to do?

214
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:32,478
Does it help the superior solution to
spread throughout the network, or does it

215
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,694
help inferior options to persist in the
network,

216
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:40,520
Or does it cause everyone in the network
to eventually become bilingual?

217
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,501
What you could have concluded from the
demonstration in that logo, let me maybe

218
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:53,098
go back to it,
Is that these bilingual nodes are allowing

219
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:58,979
the inferior solution, that is red, to
persist versus when we didn't have

220
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:05,677
bilingual nodes everything turned blue
eventually because it was, it simply had

221
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:10,578
the greater payoff.
So, bilingual nodes are good in that they

222
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:17,276
bridge, but in the long run, they may keep
the superior solution from really taking

223
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:26,684
over in the network.
One last type of complex contagion that

224
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:30,966
we'll talk about and that is collective
action.

225
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:37,926
So previously we talked about,
In complex contagion that you may wait for

226
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:44,053
a couple of your friends to wear.
Red pants, and then on subsequent days you

227
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:49,407
might start wearing red pants as well.
However, in some situations, you may want

228
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:53,320
to coordinate ahead of time, because that
first person to.

229
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,863
Show up to school in red pants, may very
well not have a very good time, because

230
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:03,471
people might ridicule them.
On the other hand,

231
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:08,565
If three of your friends all, you and
three of your friends all decide to show

232
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:12,679
up to school in red pants.
Well, people can try and ridicule you,

233
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,968
But you have strength and numbers and you
can kind of, hold together, and, and be

234
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,810
just fine.
So, another example of where this can crop

235
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,274
up is in protests.
If you go out and protest on your own,

236
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:31,534
sure you might feel silly if you're the
only holding up a sign.

237
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:38,229
But also, if for example, your protesting
in you know, against an oppressive regime,

238
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:43,082
it may be very well be dangerous,
So there's strength in numbers.

239
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:49,247
If you're one of many people protesting
then you're you know, it's like slightly

240
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,835
that you got in trouble,
So you may want to coordinate with your

241
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:57,347
friends.
So just to sum up, you want to coordinate

242
00:20:57,347 --> 00:21:03,369
that you don't end up here being the lone
protester, and that instead you're with

243
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:07,400
your friends and happily protesting.
So,

244
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,779
In general, though, different people might
have different thresholds.

245
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:16,617
So, here is a node who would go and
protest only if four people or more in

246
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:20,213
total would go.
So, he would need three other friends to

247
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:24,658
say, yes, we're going to go protest and
then he would be happy going and

248
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,861
protesting.
However, he only has two friends which

249
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:32,830
means that he doesn't even have a chance
of doing a coordination among four.

250
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,720
This node would go if three people in
total would go,

251
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,463
So, he would go if this node and this node
would go.

252
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:44,280
However, we already know that this node
would not go.

253
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,519
Now, this node, in turn, would go if just
one other person went cuz its threshold is

254
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,455
two,
So it and a friend would happily go.

255
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:59,400
But now, this one isn't going because this
one isn't going, and so, nobody goes and,

256
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,896
you know, no one goes out and protests.
In this network, on the other hand, you

257
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:08,691
would get partial turnout.
This node doesn't have a chance.

258
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:13,533
It wants to coordinate with three other
people, but it only has one friend.

259
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:18,309
So, yeah, they're not going to go out.
But these three nodes each have this

260
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,674
threshold of three and they're all talking
to each other, and hence, they'll all go

261
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:28,211
and turnout.
So see if you can answer this question

262
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:34,174
about the network here.
And we're, what we're looking for is

263
00:22:34,174 --> 00:22:42,445
whether this network is going to mobilize,
whether at least a fraction of the nodes

264
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,696
will protest.
