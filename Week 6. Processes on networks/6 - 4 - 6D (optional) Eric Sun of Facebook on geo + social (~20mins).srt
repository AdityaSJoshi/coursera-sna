1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:03,035
Hi.
So, here I am with Eric Sun of Facebook.

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:08,904
The first question to you, Eric, is how
did you come to do social network analysis

3
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:11,873
for a living and what does that entail
here?

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,313
Okay.
So I've been at Facebook for about four

5
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:19,698
and one-half years.
I started as an intern on the data science

6
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:23,003
team.
So over the last four and one-half years,

7
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,646
I've done pretty much everything related
to data here.

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,650
I first came here because I was an intern,
I was in grad school in Statistics and I

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,614
wanted to come to a.
I swear, I could have my hands on all the

10
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:41,131
data I could, I could ever want and more.
So, this is what, this is the natural

11
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,983
place to do it and I've been here ever
since.

12
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:48,856
So in the last four and a half years, I've
done everything related to data from

13
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,027
research and analysis to machine learning
to building front-end products for our

14
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:56,825
users, using our big data sets.
Hm, cool.

15
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:02,339
So specifically for this course though,
I'm trying to convince students that

16
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:07,781
knowing about social networks and doing a
little bit of analysis is useful.

17
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:13,658
So, which, if any, of, you know, aspects
of social network analysis have you found

18
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:18,084
useful in your work?
So, for my work, I would say that, so

19
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:21,742
these yeah,
Building front-end products with, with

20
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:25,982
data is one of my primary focuses.
And, especially now that we want to,

21
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:31,205
We have this, we have this graph of on
Facebook that we call the entities graph

22
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:34,401
which is everything on Facebook except for
the user.

23
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:39,624
So we're already doing pretty well at
being like the social graph of people in

24
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:42,574
the world.
But we're not doing so well yet at

25
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:45,770
modeling everything else.
So, we're talking about the,

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,628
The pages and the places people connect to
specifically.

27
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:57,957
So with this we have to, the best way for
us to scalably clean-up and model this

28
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:03,475
graph is to use crowd sourcing.
And when we're developing the crowd

29
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:10,310
sourcing algorithms, it's a huge amount of
social networking analysis to figure out

30
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:14,840
what kind of tasks to send users what kind
of,

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,097
What kind of what, what we can do to use
social signals to improve our agreement

32
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:24,401
metrics.
For example, like, how many yes votes do

33
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:29,955
we need to how many yes votes or no votes
do we need to accurately say that

34
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:33,400
something is a good judgement or not, for
example.

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,689
We also use social network analysis to do
a lot of things.

36
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:44,078
For example, the this paper I'm about to
talk, talk about where for example, using

37
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:50,350
for search ranking social signals is one
of the big factors in search ranking.

38
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,225
Cool.
So modelling not just the, the large

39
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:56,533
social network, but the whole world?
Exactly.

40
00:02:56,748 --> 00:03:00,631
Is that using social network analysis?
Exactly, yeah.

41
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:05,880
So without further ado, let's see if we
can switch into a slideshow mode.

42
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:09,239
Okay, yeah, we're fine.
Alright.

43
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,608
So now, I will talk about a paper that
Jonathan Chang, another Facebooker, and I

44
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:19,512
wrote last year on Facebook Places.
So, this is an example of how we use

45
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:25,013
social network analysis to improve a
specific product on Facebook namely the

46
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:29,520
Facebook Places service search ranking
and, and crowd sourcing.

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,949
So if you're not familiar with it, we have
a lot of location based now on Facebook

48
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:41,962
similar to Foursquare Gowalla, I guess
doesn't exist anymore, but these services

49
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:45,926
all allow users to share their location to
their friends.

50
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:50,654
And there's a lot of factors that affect
where these users check in.

51
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:56,216
And the idea we had here when working on
this paper, was to see if we can figure

52
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:59,275
out where people are going to go in the
future.

53
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:03,239
So, there's a lot of pretty obvious
implications for this.

54
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,619
One is ad targeting.
We can, if we know where you're gonna go

55
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:12,208
in the future, maybe we can send you a
coupon, or, or, or, or do something else

56
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:17,530
that will improve your user experience.
If we suspect where we if we can suspect

57
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,082
where you're going to go in the future, we
can also use that to improve search

58
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:26,452
ranking in your check-in flow.
Because maybe you can just press check-in

59
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:31,430
and then the place where we think you're
about to go, will just show up on the top.

60
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,956
Right.
So, in order to do this prediction we use

61
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:40,176
social network analysis to extract a lot
of features to, to use in machine

62
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:43,915
learning.
So, for example, we use previous check-ins

63
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:47,865
that you have.
We also use all the previous check-ins

64
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,828
that your friends have, have done
recently.

65
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,189
And as a preliminary data analysis, we
used an algorithm called LDA,

66
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:59,998
Latent Dirichlet Allocation to group
related places.

67
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:06,713
So here, we consider its basically topic
modeling, where you treat the users as

68
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:12,415
terms and the, the words in the places as,
as the, as words is in the, in the

69
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:15,979
document.
And if you run this algorithm then we

70
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,899
quickly see that related places pop up
very quickly.

71
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:25,673
So here, we, we tied running this
algorithm in San Francisco and when we ran

72
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:31,090
this, some of the topics are popped up
where with these topics, topic one, two

73
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,149
and three where topic one looks like all
our places within the Castro district of

74
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:42,664
San Francisco.
Topic two looks like I think this place is

75
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:48,362
in the Marina, in San Francisco.
And topic three are places that are not

76
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:54,445
really in any specific geographical area.
But rather, they're, these are all, like,

77
00:05:54,445 --> 00:06:01,606
Asian themed places within San Francisco.
So these are people who check-in to any of

78
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:06,691
these places are highly likely to check
into other places in, in this group.

79
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:11,719
So, it, it's pretty interesting to see
what kind of data pops up just from using

80
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:16,620
a little bit of social network analysis,
and some unsupervised learning.

81
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:23,731
So just to show some more pretty pictures.
so we some of the other [unknown] features

82
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:27,863
we use around predicting check-ins was
first demographics.

83
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:33,010
So here, in this heat map lighter areas
mean more check-in activity.

84
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,090
So, if you're familiar with San Francisco,
this is a, a map of, of the various

85
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,102
neighborhoods of San Francisco.
And we see that males typically check into

86
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:47,640
the Castro District,
Which is a very gay heavy area of San

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,026
Francisco.
Whereas, the females tend to check in, in,

88
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:57,398
in the financial district in, in do you
know what that neighborhood is?

89
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:02,106
North Beach I think, where, where a lot of
the clubs are.

90
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:08,867
And therefore it's pretty striking the,
the, how different males and females use

91
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:12,838
Facebook places.
There's also a temporal feature. So, we

92
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:17,894
realize that most of the morning check-ins
are around like the financial district

93
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:21,409
where people are just getting to work and
checking in.

94
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:26,897
People don't check in as nearly as much in
the morning as at night in, on the right

95
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:32,200
side of the screen where tons of check-in
activity are to night clubs and areas

96
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,530
where night life is, is really big in San
Francisco.

97
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,543
,, the next step is to actually predict
check-ins.

98
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:45,309
So we do the standard thing in machine
learning where we hold out some check-ins

99
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:50,810
and run a regression to try and predict
where someone is going to check-in next

100
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:54,323
using all these features that I just
mentioned.

101
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:57,703
And it turns out we can actually do pretty
well.

102
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:02,873
So, if we want a recall of 60%,, we can
actually predict with 90% precision, the

103
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:08,109
next place that a given user is going to
check-in which, which was pretty

104
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:12,648
surprising to us cuz that is,
It's, it means we're doing pretty well

105
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:18,018
with a large percentage of, of our data.
Not surprisingly, predicting whether

106
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:24,241
someone will comment on this check-in is a
lot more difficult because that's just a

107
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:29,722
lot of a lot of noise and a lot of just a
lot more randomness.

108
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:35,352
So here, we see that with a 60% recall
rate we can only predict with about

109
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:40,833
six percent precision, so this is, this is
basically just noise, which was not too

110
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,389
surprising.
However, we do see there are patterns.

111
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:50,599
So we did notice that responses are much
more likely when someone checks in far

112
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:54,939
from your usual location.
This is typically when I am going on

113
00:08:54,939 --> 00:09:00,348
vacation and I check in to, let's say,
Hawaii, where, whereas normally I live in

114
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:04,021
San Francisco.
So my friends are much more likely to

115
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,360
comment naturally if I'm on vacation at
Hawaii.

116
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,491
So here at the blue line is, is likes, and
the red line is comments I believe.

117
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:18,107
And the x axis is the log of log of
distance in kilometers.

118
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:24,410
So, the, the further away you go, the more
feedback you get on your check-ins.

119
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:31,385
Not surprisingly, we also get a lot of
boost when someone checks in close to the

120
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:35,292
commenter/liker.
So if I'm if I live in San Francisco, and

121
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:40,707
I suddenly go to, let's say, Berkeley.
And I'm now very close to my friend, who

122
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:45,026
lives at Berkeley,
Then they are also much more likely to, to

123
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:49,139
comment or like my post.
This is also not very surprising.

124
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:54,143
And it's good to see this, these kinds of
things born out in the data.

125
00:09:54,143 --> 00:10:00,212
So, whenever we're doing these kinds of
analyses social network analysis, in

126
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:04,610
particular, or, or otherwise,
It's really important to do enough just

127
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,549
background summary statistics and some
basic plots to make sure you understand

128
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,441
your data.
And to make sure that your data is

129
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:15,995
standing correct.
And you can figure out if there's any

130
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:20,633
outliers you need to get rid of or
anything else you need to clean up before

131
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:23,654
diving into anything deeper.
Alright.

132
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:27,591
So, just to talk about some of these
applications.

133
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:32,514
So we, we have this graph.
And right now, the big focus on our team

134
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:38,799
is to use crowd sourcing to improve the
graph of places, by adding metadata and

135
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,206
removing places oh, sorry, removing
duplicates.

136
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:47,658
So these, these are some screenshots of
some, some units we have on our, on our

137
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:52,959
home page where we, we ask users, like
what kind of places is this cafe in

138
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,821
Seattle?
We also have a flow where users can add

139
00:10:56,821 --> 00:05:32,012
data like categories, name, address, city,
town to any place that is not owned, and

140
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:09,831
help us fill out our graph.
So, there's a lot of really interesting

141
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:13,781
work being done in this, in crowd
sourcing, in particular.

142
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:20,129
Because as I touched on earlier we want to
only accept suggestions that, that are,

143
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,868
that are good.
And how do we figure out what's, what's

144
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:29,723
actually good is that we do a lot of
analysis to use lots of social features

145
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:34,590
around demographics,
Around whether you've, you've interacted

146
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,681
with this place.
Whether your friends have interacted with

147
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:43,744
this place, to try and get a sense of
whether you are likely to provide good

148
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,932
feedback cuz on a Facebook scale, we have
users of all kinds.

149
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:51,929
We have spammers.
We have we have people who just don't know

150
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,101
what they're doing.
People who are, like, very young.

151
00:11:55,291 --> 00:12:00,621
13-year-old girls generally don't provide
really good crowd sourcing suggestions,

152
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,983
we've found.
But using these social features, we

153
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:09,470
actually can provide some meaningful lift
and figure out what crowd sourcing how,

154
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,560
how to use social signals to improve our
crowd sourcing.

155
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:18,888
So some other applications which I touched
on earlier is just better ranking for

156
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:23,180
Facebook places.
More ad targeting and also recommending

157
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,563
places you might go in the future.
So, these are all areas that we're, we're

158
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:32,127
actively working on.
Alright. So thanks, Eric.

159
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:37,728
I think that was a nice broader
introduction to data issues and useful

160
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:39,619
applications.
So thanks.

161
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:40,711
Sure.
Thanks.
