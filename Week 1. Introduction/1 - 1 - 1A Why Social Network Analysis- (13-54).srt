00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,584
Welcome to Social Network Analysis.
My name is Lada Adamic I'm an associate

2
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:10,334
professor at the University of Michigan.
I'm affiliated with the School of

3
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:15,533
Information, The Center for the Study of
Complex Systems and the Computer Science

4
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:19,188
Department.
What I'd like to show you in this course

5
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:24,007
is what we can get out of modeling the
world around us as networks.

6
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:28,970
Now the world is very complex and once you
represent it as a network,

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,952
It may not really look any less complex,
But indeed, we can gain very useful

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:39,101
insights.
We can start to understand how information

9
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:44,286
diffuses in social networks.
We can also understand how resilient

10
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:50,747
different infrastructure networks, such as
roads, or the electrical power grid are,

11
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:57,053
to random or intentional builders.
Here's one example I'd like to start with.

12
00:00:57,053 --> 00:01:01,933
These are hand drawn networks made by the
artist Mark Lombardi.

13
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:07,743
He constructed them by pouring over news
articles in the 1980's and 1990's,

14
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:13,166
Making connections between political
entities and different financial

15
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:18,217
institutions and corporations.
When you leave them out, you could see

16
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:24,104
connections that might not otherwise be
obvious just by reading the news articles

17
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:27,837
one by one.
Here's Michael Kimmelman a columnist for

18
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:33,796
the New York Times commenting on having
encounters a few folks from the Department

19
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:37,960
of Homeland Security at an exhibit of Mark
Lombardi's art.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,509
They found the work revelatory,
Not because the financial and political

21
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,976
connections he mapped were new to them,
But because Lombardi showed them an

22
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:51,146
elegant way to array this spread
information, and make sense of things,

23
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:54,780
Which they thought might be useful to
their security efforts.

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,365
Now, in this class I'm not going to make
you do hand-drawn network layouts, even

25
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:06,473
though there really hard to beat, but Mark
Lombardi would spend days drawing these

26
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:12,356
over and over until they were perfect.
Instead, what we are going to be doing is

27
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:16,900
using automated layout algorithms, in
software such as Gephi.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,111
Now, here is a nice example of how
automated layout algorithms make things

29
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:25,914
very apparent.
All they're doing is placing nodes that

30
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:30,984
are connected through edges close together
and, other nodes are repelled.

31
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:36,125
Actually, all nodes experience a
reflection force so that they're not all

32
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:40,069
clumped together unless the ties bring
them together.

33
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,562
This is a data set of political blogs
prior to the 2004 presidential election

34
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:50,070
and this is who follows who,
Who, who has whom on their blog roll.

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,543
The Liberals are colored in blue, the
Liberal blogs.

36
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:58,106
The Conservatives are colored red.
Liberal to Liberal ties are blue,

37
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:03,009
Conservative to Conservative are red.
Liberal to Conservative are purple,

38
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:09,129
Conservative to Liberal, orangish yellow.
And what is apparent right away is that to

39
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,388
some extent, there's an echo chamber
effect,

40
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:18,527
Where Liberals are primarily talking to
Liberals and Conservatives are primarily

41
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:23,378
talking to Conservatives,
And all I really had to do was run one

42
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:27,471
layer algorithm.
I did not have, in this case, although we

43
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:32,398
did do this in our study,
To even do any calculations for this

44
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:38,070
pattern to be to be apparent.
Now here is another example of the data

45
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,086
set I have gathered, This is an
organization of Hewlett-Packard labs, so a

46
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:46,915
bunch of researchers,
And what we looked at were, was there

47
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:50,809
e-mail communication.
If two people had exchanged at least a

48
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:56,089
couple of emails back and forth over the
period of a few months they get a gray

49
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:59,501
etch.
I've overlaid here black edges, which

50
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:04,000
represent the formal organization, who
reports to whom.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,396
Now, what is immediately apparent from
this visualization, and what we confirmed

52
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:12,088
in the study,
Is that the email communication is more

53
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:17,884
likely to occur between individuals who
are closer together in the organizational

54
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,560
hierarchy.
But there are enough shortcuts across the

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,426
organization that any two individuals are
connected through a short number of hops.

56
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:33,010
But the fact that those hops roughly
follow the organizational hierarchy makes

57
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:39,626
the e-mail network navigable.
So informal collaboration getting the job

58
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:48,111
done, it's reflected in this network.
This network is my Facebook network and

59
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:53,720
what I've done here is I've used an
automated community detection algorithm,

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,254
in addition to an automated layout
algorithm [laugh] to layout my Facebook

61
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:02,759
friends.
And what the automated community detection

62
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,268
algorithm did was it said, oh, there seem
to be some people in your network who are,

63
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:13,753
tied together and" more so, they're
connected more than they are to the rest

64
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:18,324
of your network.
And indeed, once you're working with this

65
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:24,953
data, within an automized version of this
data, you'll see that the different groups

66
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:31,506
roughly corresponds to different context
in, which I've met people from school to

67
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:35,240
work, to outside of school and work
activities.

68
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,326
And this you can just tell without, you
know, without really knowing anything

69
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:43,520
about my life, you can look at my network
and, and understand quite a bit of it.

70
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,117
The final network is one of ingredients,
recipe ingredients.

71
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:54,072
We analyzed tens of thousands of recipes
to figure out which ingredients go well

72
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:59,880
together and then we made a network.
In fact, we made several networks and in

73
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,855
this one you can see that there are two
main communities. One of savorier

74
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:07,716
ingredients, and one of sweeter
ingredients.

75
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:13,039
And actually, at the very top, there's a
smaller community, and you'll, you'll play

76
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,231
with this data in time.
That is the mixed drink community, where

77
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:20,824
you have ingredients such as vodka and,
and lime juice.

78
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:26,080
So, what I've shown you so far is that,
you know, even just visualization can buy

79
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,470
you a lot in understanding what the myriad
of connections that we know are there,

80
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:36,528
Can, can represent,
But that might be rather invisible to us

81
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:42,988
untill we represent them as this network
where they're all connected together and

82
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:46,880
this is where we're going to get the nice
insight.

83
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:53,427
I am going to be using maybe somewhat
inconsistent terminology, so I may

84
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:56,908
alternate between the words network and
graph.

85
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:03,642
Graph is the terminology where, you know,
it all started in the field of mathematic,

86
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:09,846
but I'm more likely to use the word
network for example the new emerging field

87
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:15,827
now is network science and it doesn't make
a network any less of a graph, it's just

88
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:20,531
that you can use both terms.
Similarly, I'm going to primarily use the

89
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:26,594
words nodes." and esges,
However, nodes can also be referred to as

90
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:31,191
vertices. if you're talking, bbout
sociological phenomenon.

91
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:35,165
Are you talking to a sociologist?
They might use the word, actor.

92
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:39,516
Similarly, for ties, a sociologist might
say, ties, [laugh] or relations.

93
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:44,561
A physicist might talk about sites and
bonds, although physicists who work on

94
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:49,039
networks do say, nodes and edges.
And finally, in computer science, you

95
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,148
might be talking about links, especially
if you're talking about networks, such as

96
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:57,668
the World Wide Web.
So we have a variety of terminology, it's,

97
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:02,227
it's very easy to, get used to it, and all
we're talking about in the end is that you

98
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:06,287
have different entities and the
connections between those entities, and

99
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:12,910
that is what we're going to analyze.
Let me get to the goals in this course.

100
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:20,033
In addition to making pretty pictures we
need to really understand what the

101
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,292
structure of a network is.
So we're going to do some measurement and

102
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:29,490
in this measurement, we're going to look
at whether nodes are connected through the

103
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,621
network.
We're going to look at how far apart they

104
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:36,504
are in the network.
How many hops does it take following these

105
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,700
different connections?
We're going to look at whether some nodes

106
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,959
are more important than others due to
their position in the network.

107
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,204
And we're going to look at whether there
are these communities in the network, that

108
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:55,450
is, sets of nodes that are especially
densely connected.

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,799
We are not going to be satisfied just
knowing that there's this structure.

110
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,031
We want to know where does this structure
come from?

111
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:09,880
What kinds of processes shape a network?
So we're going to start with randomly

112
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,666
generated networks, where you're just
throwing edges at random and connecting

113
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,333
different minutes.
Then we're going to look at preferential

114
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,690
attachment where it's a phenomenon of rich
get richer.

115
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,476
As new edges are added, they're more
likely to be added to the nodes that are

116
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:30,330
already popular, in a sense.
They already have many other edges.

117
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,136
We're going to be looking at small world
networks as well so you might have

118
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:42,631
processes, such as a friend of a friend is
likely to be a friend because friends tend

119
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:48,819
to introduce their friends to each other.
And yet any two people in the world are

120
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:55,084
connected through a short number of hops.
So recently a Facebook study showed that

121
00:09:55,084 --> 00:10:01,120
any two people in the Facebook graph are
connected with an average of 4.7 hops.

122
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,507
We're going to see how certain processes
might shape such small-world structure,

123
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:12,993
for example, how do small worlds arise out
of optimization, for example, airline

124
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:18,448
networks might be optimized to ferry
passengers back and forth in a way that is

125
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:21,800
efficient and doesn't cost the airlines
much money.

126
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,992
You might also have strategic network
formation at the level of the individual,

127
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:31,922
so the individual is getting something out
of participating in the network.

128
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,800
And so they may choose to connect to some
nodes and not others.

129
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,100
Okay.
So,

130
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,258
We're going, we've described the network
structure.

131
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:44,732
We figured out where that network
structure comes from.

132
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:49,659
And the final goal is to understand how
that network structure now influences

133
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,450
different processes occurring on the
networking [inaudible].

134
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,372
So for example, we're going to learn how
information diffusion is affected by the

135
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:01,837
network structure.
If any two people are, are connected

136
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:06,455
through a short number of pops does this
mean that information will readily

137
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:09,251
diffuse.
Sometimes it's not information that's

138
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:13,505
diffusing but something that we don't want
to diffuse such as a virus.

139
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:18,996
So, how does the social network actually
influence how quickly a virus is going to

140
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:24,300
spread, and what immunization strategies
can you use once you know what the

141
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,085
structure of the network is?
We may study the process, or we are going

142
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:32,241
to study processes such as opinion
formation.

143
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:38,412
This can be, kind of a consensus, that can
be reached across the network as

144
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:44,023
individuals continuously update their
beliefs or it may be just a single shot,

145
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:49,773
You, you, you form your opinion only once,
But it is influenced by what your friends

146
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,578
think.
We're also going to be looking at

147
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:57,628
coordination and cooperation.
If you have a certain task that you'd like

148
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:01,447
to do, but it,
But it depends on increments from the

149
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:06,496
nodes that you're tied to, how quickly can
you accomplish the task?

150
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:11,889
And finally, we're going to look at
resilience to attack, so if for some

151
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:17,300
reason, a certain, subset of the nodes,
are removed from the network, can the

152
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,747
network still function?
Now, I filled in the first six weeks, so

153
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:27,836
you might be wondering what we're going to
be doing in weeks seven and eight.

154
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:33,652
In week seven, we're going to look at cool
and unusual applications of social network

155
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,956
analysis.
We're going to be looking at things such

156
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:41,120
as recipe ingredient networks for
predicting recipe ratings.

157
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,665
We're going to be looking at the social
networks of dolphins and, we're also going

158
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:51,559
to look at, economic development.
So if you have the network of countries

159
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,843
and the products that they produce, can
you actually make predictions about which

160
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:01,671
products the countries are going to
produce in the future and how rapidly

161
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:04,934
those countries are going to develop
economically.

162
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:11,263
In the final week, we're going to look at
how a social network analysis is used by

163
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:17,499
companies such as Google, Facebook,
Linkedin, Twitter, CouchSurfing, to

164
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:24,652
enhance their product offerings.
So what kind of social network analysis do

165
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:28,871
they do?
What kinds of research have they done?

166
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:33,090
And, how has this impacted and, benefited,
the,

167
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,176
The features of the social networks that
they enable?

168
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:42,627
So those are that's the outline of the
course.

169
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:50,165
In the next video I'm going to dive right
into it and we are going to visualize

170
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:54,690
some,
Some networks and see what it's all about.
