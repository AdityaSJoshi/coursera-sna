00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,770
This week we'll be discussing cool and
unusual applications of social network

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,677
analysis.
This will range from looking at the

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:16,753
connections between diseases and genes to
derive a human disease zone.

4
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:23,457
We'll be looking at recipes and the
relationship between the ingredients and

5
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:27,587
those recipes.
One of those will be my own work on

6
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:32,377
predicting recipe ratings from the network
of ingredients.

7
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:38,902
But also, we'll be looking at a paper that
looks at the relationship between

8
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:43,610
ingredients through the flavor compounds
that they share.

9
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,752
And so you'll be getting a new dataset to
play with in the assignment.

10
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:53,381
Also, you'll be playing with the disease
zone in the assignment.

11
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:59,553
You'll be looking at the social network of
dolphins, and what centrality means in

12
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:03,079
such a network whether there's
assortativity.

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,235
Another subject will be the product space,
which is this network of products that are

14
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:16,192
related because countries tend to,
Well, if they export one, they also tend

15
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:22,230
to, are likely to export the other.
And you're going to see what this means

16
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:27,498
for economic development.
Now, with the exception of the one recipe

17
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:33,955
paper where I was one of the co-authors,
and so I have prepared a short lecture on

18
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:38,450
that paper.
I will actually direct you to others,

19
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:44,194
That is, to external videos where one of
the authors of the paper is actually

20
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:48,789
presenting the paper.
So this is how you learn about the disease

21
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:54,390
loem from Laszlo Barabasi, whom you know
from the Barabasi Albert Preferential

22
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,206
Attachment Model, among other things.
You'll be listening to Cesar Hidalgo talk

23
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:05,304
about the product space network.
And you'll be listening to Yy Ahn talk

24
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:10,364
about the flavor network.
Now I think this is a bit better than my

25
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:15,459
rehashing those papers.
We can really take advantage of the work

26
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:20,555
being recent and being able to hear from
the authors themselves.

27
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:27,323
And I hope that the assignment is going to
bring it together for you so that you can

28
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:32,361
see how easy it is in fact to drive
interesting results, simply by

29
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:38,507
constructing networks in an intuitive and
clever way, and hopefully it would also

30
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:44,578
make you think about where you would like
to apply your social network analysis

31
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:50,193
skills once this class is over.
It hopefully will give you a sense of what

32
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:56,264
are the possibilities with, you know, in
using the tools that you have learned in

33
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:59,983
this class.
So I hope you will find this week fun.
