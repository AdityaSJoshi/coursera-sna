00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,036
Hi. Welcome to Week three of Social
Network Analysis.

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:09,858
This week we'll be tackling Centrality.
Centrality tells us which nodes are

3
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:14,904
important in the network.
This goes beyond just looking at social

4
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:21,579
networks and which nodes might be popular.
And to looking at all sorts of different

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:26,315
networks, trade networks.
Who are the most important importers,

6
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:31,748
exporters? nodes that bridge different
regions and facilitate trade.

7
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:36,918
In biological networks.
Which genes, for example, play a very

8
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:41,332
crucial role in regulating entire systems
and processes.

9
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:47,393
And infrastructure networks, which nodes
are critical, such that if you were to

10
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:54,052
remove them you would significantly impede
the functioning of whatever the network is

11
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:58,317
supposed to do.
So identifying such important nodes is, is

12
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:04,527
pretty critical and it may be one of the
first things you want to do when you look

13
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:09,500
at a network is look at what nodes are
more central.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,429
If you go to the website,
moviegalaxies.com,

15
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:17,744
What you'll see are a bunch of networks
that have been constructed out of the

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,083
scripts.
So they parts, I'm guessing automatically,

17
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:26,193
through the scripts, and see this
character address this other character at

18
00:01:26,193 --> 00:01:29,804
this point in the movie script.
So let's draw an edge.

19
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:34,574
So if you look at, for example, the 1993
movie, The Fugitive, you can see

20
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:38,389
immediately that there's this central node
here, Kimball.

21
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,864
And this is Dr.
Richard Kimball, who is the fugitive.

22
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:45,099
Falsely convicted of,
Murdering his wife.

23
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:51,135
And you see here a secondary important
individual who is Deputy Gerard from the

24
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:55,862
US Marshals Service who is pursuing
Kimball throughout the movie.

25
00:01:55,862 --> 00:02:01,824
And this you can immediately infer without
ever having seen them. Well you can't

26
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:07,860
infer all those details but you can infer
that both Kimball and Gerard are central

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,278
actors.
Similarly if you look at Heap you see a

28
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:15,486
similar pattern.
Where Detective Hannah is, pursuing Neil

29
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:20,746
who's like a, a long time crook, right?
And you, you start to see, these kinds of

30
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:23,902
patterns.
Now, of course if the, if the movie just

31
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:27,715
has one central actor.
For example, in Memento, there's just

32
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,950
Leonard.
And he's the most central.

33
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,683
So even though he may not actually
remember having all these etches, all

34
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:39,877
these interactions because what happens is
he keeps, he keeps losing his memory,

35
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:45,400
We can see, in fact, that over the course
of the movie, he's the most central actor.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,130
The question is though, is counting edges
enough?

37
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,637
So what I'm showing you here, is a
fragment of the network.

38
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:58,066
My first social network that I ever
gathered data for.

39
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,408
And this was, these were Stanford
homepages.

40
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:08,168
So take yourself back to 1999 and this was
before Friendster, before Facebook, before

41
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:12,520
MySpace really.
People were still constructing social

42
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,766
networks.
Online, and the best way that they knew

43
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:18,900
how, which was to link their home pages
together.

44
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,319
And the way that I caught on to this was
that well, this was actually back in, in,

45
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:28,433
my undergrad days.
A friend of mine had linked from her home

46
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:33,003
page to mine and said hey Aida, how come
you're not linking back to me?

47
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:36,660
And so I started...
Actually my home page had a friend's.

48
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:42,350
Page that linked to my friends, and once I
was at Stanford and in grad school and

49
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,195
starting to study networks, I grew
curious.

50
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:48,107
You know, how many people actually did
this.

51
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:53,188
And so I gathered the data, and this is
the local neighbor, my local network

52
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:57,930
neighborhood in the Stanford home pages.
I linked to Orkut Buyukokkten.

53
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:06,379
Who here looks very sensual.
He, he is also linked to or, or links to

54
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:13,751
many other friends.
And in fact Well, I mean he was sort of

55
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:18,437
the center of my social universe in, in
graduate school.

56
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:23,365
Now the complete picture though is
something like this, right.

57
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:28,945
So Sure, you know, if you look at degree,
Orkut may be one of the highest degree

58
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:34,653
individuals in the network, but still you
would probably say that he's peripheral to

59
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:38,526
this whole network.
However, that didn't last long, because

60
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:43,350
Orkut actually created Club Nexis, which
was it had exactly the same

61
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,854
functionalities as Facebook, was created
around the same time as Facebook, but was

62
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:53,270
for Standford students.
And there he definitely was the center of

63
00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:01,358
the network Then when he eventually
started working for Google, excuse me, he,

64
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,552
He created there for social networking
service that was called orku.com and was

65
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:13,633
incredibly you know, successful there so
much so that, Well where that service

66
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:20,082
flourished was in especially in Brazil and
in India, and so when he went to Brazil he

67
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:25,577
actually needed a security detail.
He'd become so, so very central thanks to

68
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:28,802
starting this hugely popular social
network.

69
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:34,737
But back to this picture it tells us that
back in 1999 when Orku was still a new

70
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:38,358
grad student.
Maybe you know, his close friends have

71
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:42,394
come to appreciate him.
But he was still not the center of the

72
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:46,561
Stanford social life.
So what kinds of centrality measures could

73
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:51,717
we use in order to make that distinction?
So there are many different notions of

74
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:55,035
centrality.
We talked about in-degree and out-degree

75
00:05:55,035 --> 00:06:00,521
before and we'll review them but there are
also notions of between-ness closeness and

76
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:03,520
we'll also talk about eye conductor
centrality.

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,253
So in-degree is just the number of
incoming edges that a node has and here X

78
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:13,796
has higher in-degree than Y, Y happens to
have in-degree zero.

79
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:20,125
I have here plotted the network of oil
experts using the NBR United Nations trade

80
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,551
data.
In fact I think they, they based the data

81
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:29,434
in imports rather than exports but you
know you can because they consider them

82
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:34,944
more reliable but you can kind of
symmetrize the, the two and I use the

83
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:39,928
category that, that corresponds to
petroleum and petroleum products.

84
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:45,732
And you can see this, every node is a
country and there's a directed edge from

85
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:50,878
the exporter to the importer.
So just to check your understanding which

86
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:55,793
countries have high in degree, that is,
they import petroleum and petroleum

87
00:06:55,793 --> 00:07:01,157
products from many others?
Now let's talk about out degree, out

88
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:07,110
degree is just the number of edges that
eminate form a particular node.

89
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,338
So here, I have just modified the same
network of oil trade.

90
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:16,503
And I have sized, the nodes by their
exports.

91
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:22,441
And I've also colored according to the
ratio of exports to imports.

92
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:26,606
So if that ratio is high, the node is more
blue.

93
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:30,594
If that ratio is low, the node is more
red.

94
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:36,000
So, for example, here, the US imports much
more than it exports.

95
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:43,222
So just to see if we know what's going on.
Which country has low out degree but

96
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:47,620
exports a significant quantity of
petroleum products.

97
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:58,908
In this First visualization.
You may have seen Singapore actually have

98
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:05,116
a non-significant out degree.
And that's a little bit puzzling because

99
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:11,147
Singapore is a city-state.
So where is it getting this oil to export?

100
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:17,090
So what I've done is I have excluded you
know, everything except.

101
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,194
For crude petroleum, that is the actual
oil as opposed to derivative products.

102
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:28,231
And here you can see, that Singapore
becomes primarily an importer.

103
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:33,191
It has indegree, but it doesn't really
have significant outdegree.

104
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:36,321
So.
This illustrates the point that when

105
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:42,674
you're talking about centrality, it's very
important to know first, what does your

106
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:45,576
network represent.
What is it's scope?

107
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:51,301
Here scope is not that much of an issue
because we have all countries.

108
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:55,066
However, you know, what exactly do the
edges mean?

109
00:08:55,066 --> 00:09:01,497
Is it a crude oil or is it refined oil,
even a little tweak can make a significant

110
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:05,020
difference.
It's you just have to know what your

111
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,407
network is, and when you're talking to
others you have to honestly represent that

112
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:13,929
as well.
So let's put some numbers to it, let's

113
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:18,290
quantify centrality.
If, and let's switch to an undirected mode

114
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,121
and networks for the time being.
So, in undirected degree all we're doing

115
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:28,824
is we're counting the number of edges you
have so if it's a friendship graph it just

116
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:34,308
counts the number of friends.
And the basic assumption here is that, it

117
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:40,660
doesn't matter, how many, friends your
friends have, or, you know, anything else.

118
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,646
You're just counting the number.
That's, that's all that counts.

119
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:51,596
You can normalize this measure, by
dividing, by the maximum, number possible,

120
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:57,868
for the degree, which is n minus one, as
we saw, you know, just, just last week.

121
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:00,430
So.
Here.

122
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:09,165
This node has a normalized centrality of.5
because it's connected to three of the

123
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:13,667
possible six.
Other nodes that are in the network and

124
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:19,756
although I don't personally normalize
centrality degree that often you will just

125
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:23,381
for my own purposes I, I like having the
raw count.

126
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:29,761
And especially with large networks it's
you know, have a network of a 1,000,000

127
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:35,633
nodes no one's is going to have you know
all this normalized degree centralities

128
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:41,867
are going to be.0000 right because you are
not going to be connected to all the other

129
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,550
nodes that's ridiculous.
But a lot.

130
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,117
Social analysis software does like to
normalize.

131
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:52,595
So I would just like you to get used to
these normalized scores.

132
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:58,191
And of course you can just multiply by n
minus one to get the, the, the degree

133
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,200
back, the number of neighbors for each
node.

134
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:09,318
Centrality refers to an individual node.
But there is a network wide measure called

135
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:14,801
centralization, that characterizes the
entire network and what it does is it

136
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:19,058
captures the inequality and the
distribution of centrality.

137
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:23,242
So it could be the inequality of degree
between the nodes.

138
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:28,826
And for this you know, it, it doesn't.
Matter that much what particular measure

139
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:33,238
of centralization used?
You could just use the standard deviation

140
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:36,700
in degree.
And I have used this for example, when

141
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,704
studying trading networks for commodity
future's contracts.

142
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:43,827
Right?
We just looked at standard deviation in

143
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:47,356
degree.
But we also threw in something called the

144
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:52,990
genie coefficient, which varies from zero
if everyone has the same degree to one if

145
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,470
one node has you know, all the degree and
all the other nodes have.

146
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,470
Degree zero, which you might see in a
star, formation.

147
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:08,674
There's also Freeman's General Formula for
Centralization and what you look at there

148
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:15,305
is you sum over all the nodes, you take
the maximum value that you observe in the

149
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:22,292
network, you subtract The centrality of
that particular node and you do this for

150
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:28,762
all the nodes, and then you normalize by
this number of, of pairs, right.

151
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:35,658
And it's just one lower because you get 0s
for the node that has the, the highest,

152
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:38,880
centrality.
So.

153
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,188
Let's look at a few examples.
This is with Freeman, centralization.

154
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:52,868
Here, as promised in the star formation,
you have perfect centralization.

155
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:57,564
You got 1.0.
Here in the line graph, The nodes look

156
00:12:57,564 --> 00:13:00,399
pretty similar as far as degree is
concerned.

157
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,060
We'll see later that using other
centrality measures, right, the one that's

158
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,721
in the middle might end up being more
central. But here, all we're doing is

159
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:13,186
counting degree.
So, all these nodes look pretty similar,

160
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:16,210
giving us a relatively low centralization
value.

161
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:21,338
And this similar thing happens for this
kind of butterfly network where, again,

162
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:25,810
the nodes have either Degree two or three,
and it's all very similar.

163
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,381
I mentioned these trading networks that I
had analyzed.

164
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:37,861
So these are brokers and they're trading
in futurist contracts having to do with

165
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:42,515
the S and P 500.
And in this case what I've done is I've

166
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:49,164
sized the nodes by their n degree, so the
larger the, the node appears, the higher

167
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:53,237
its in degree, and I've colored them by
out degree.

168
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:58,186
So the larger the out degree, the,
The darker the note.

169
00:13:58,426 --> 00:14:05,008
And in any case you can see that here the
network has very high in centralization

170
00:14:05,008 --> 00:14:11,912
because one node really dominates it has a
very in degree and most of the others have

171
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:18,413
relatively even in degree and lower in
degree and here on the right you see that

172
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:24,995
actually all the nodes have relatively
even indegree and no one is really hogging

173
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:29,377
all the N-links.
So, there is an example where we could

174
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:35,572
actually use centralization of the home
network and correlate it with other

175
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:39,566
variables.
For example, the returns and volume and

176
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:44,620
other kind of financial properties of the
system at that time.

177
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,216
But let's return to this question of
things that to, that simply counting the

178
00:14:52,216 --> 00:14:58,357
number of edges doesn't capture.
If we look at this graph degree may very

179
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:02,320
well capture what's going on but if we
look at.

180
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,981
This network,
Right, this node has Degree two which

181
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:11,854
makes it kind of less importance and in
the degree sense then these two nodes and

182
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:16,966
you know about of equal importance so
these two nodes. But you know, in two

183
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:22,493
degree, we think that this node must be
important because everyone here who may

184
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:28,020
want to get in touch with any one here is
going to have to go through this node.

185
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,283
So how, how would one capture that.
Similarly here, degrees has all of these

186
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:38,964
are equal, but this one if it wanted to
visit any of other nodes it would just

187
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:43,479
make two hops max.
And all the other nodes could potentially

188
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:49,379
have to make three or four hops. If they
want to reach some of the individuals in

189
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:52,146
the network.
So how do we capture that?

190
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:55,497
Well let's return to the Standford Social
Web.

191
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:58,774
Right.
Here again, we have that Orkut is very

192
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:02,265
central locally.
And, certainly for my social,

193
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:06,916
neighborhood..
If any of us want to get in touch with

194
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:13,478
under grads and so on, may be, you know,
Orkut would be our best, choice and he

195
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:17,963
would kinda be between us and the rest of
the network.

196
00:16:17,963 --> 00:16:24,773
But, overall, his betweenness might not be
as high. As for example, some of the other

197
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:31,240
nodes kind of closer in, and his
closeness, in a sense that he is not, you

198
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,850
know, very proximate to the rest of the
networks should be low as well.

199
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:43,502
So let's first talk about brokerage. This
is where a node lies between other people,

200
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,750
here X plays more of a brokerage role than
y, because.

201
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,944
These two nodes would have to go through X
to talk to these two nodes.

202
00:16:53,944 --> 00:17:00,405
And there is a bunch of research into
this. In particular, Ron Burt at the

203
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:04,830
University of Chicago Business School, has
studied.

204
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:12,900
What advantages individuals who occupy
such roles might have.

205
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:19,657
And he's found things such as, they're
more likely to generate creative ideas.

206
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,654
If he studies them within an
organizational context, their ideas are

207
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:31,650
more likely to be accepted.
They're more likely to receive favorable

208
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,620
reviews, and they're more likely to be
credited.

209
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:40,181
Now of course, there's a little bit of an
ambiguity.

210
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:45,102
Is it that the person enjoys these
advantages because they occupy that

211
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:50,291
position in the network or did they come
to occupy that position, because they're a

212
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,416
special kind of person who does generate
creatives ideas, etcetera?

213
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,229
Right?
And this is a little bit of an, ongoing,

214
00:17:57,229 --> 00:18:00,167
debate.
The consensus seems to be that, you know,

215
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:04,918
if you, if you put someone incompetent in
that position, they're not going to

216
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,356
suddenly, start to blossom and do really,
really well.

217
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:12,982
But if you have a good person in that
position they're an even, in an even

218
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:17,640
better position, or can, can accomplish
even more when they're in the brokerage

219
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,991
position.
And this goes back to the notion of

220
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:27,511
constraint.
And that is that, if you are not a broker

221
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:35,472
You experience constraint in the sense
that your contacts are talking to each

222
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:38,406
other.
Which means that you can't say one thing

223
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:42,756
to one and another thing to another
because they're communicating with each

224
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,331
other.
And so you are constrained in what you

225
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:49,091
might be able to pull off.
On the other hand, if you're in this

226
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:54,138
brokerage position, you can turn to one
part of your network and say hey I would

227
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:58,175
do business only with you.
And they, you know, they have no reason

228
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,708
not to believe you.
But you could turn around and, to the

229
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:07,008
other side of the network that you're kind
of hm, bridging and you can say oh you

230
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:10,288
guys are my favorites and no one would be
the wiser.

231
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:15,209
And so this is what's called like when
you're brokerage position you actually

232
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:19,313
experience low constraint.
So let's look at this measure of

233
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:22,897
betweenness which is going to capture
brokerage.

234
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:29,020
The basic idea is that you're asking how
many pairs of individuals in the network.

235
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,812
Would be connected through you, on their
shortest path to each other.

236
00:19:34,812 --> 00:19:40,350
So are you on the shortest path between
those, other two nodes?

237
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,035
And, it's possible for there to be
multiple short paths.

238
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:51,340
In that case, what you're going to get, so
here, you're I, and you are on the.

239
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,115
One of the shortest paths between J and K,
or one or more of the shortest paths

240
00:19:57,115 --> 00:20:01,208
between J and K.
But the credit you get is the number of

241
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:07,276
shortest paths that you're on divided the
number of shortest paths that J and K

242
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:10,566
have.
And then, you're between-ness is the sum

243
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:15,755
over all pairs of nodes, JK.
And you can normalize this, again I, you

244
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:22,104
know for between us it might make more
sense because these values can indeed

245
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:28,782
become very astronomical but you're just
normalizing by the number of pair of

246
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:35,873
vertices excluding I itself so for what
fraction of the other nodes are you on the

247
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:41,943
short path?
So let's look at a few examples on Toy

248
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:45,939
Networks here.
The central node has between this ten.

249
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:51,459
Because there are, five  four / two,
because we don't care about direction.

250
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:56,616
Different pairs that go through the
central node in order to reach one

251
00:20:56,616 --> 00:21:00,175
another.
But each one of those nodes individually

252
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:05,840
has between a zero.'Cause no one has to go
through them to got to anyone else.

253
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,210
So let's return to our line graph. And
here, naturally A has zero betweenness

254
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,648
because it's not on the path between any
other nodes.

255
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:24,265
B has betweenness three because A relies
on it to reach every one of the three

256
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:28,871
other nodes.
C has betweenness four, because it is on

257
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:34,620
the path between A and B, and D and E.
Note that in this case C gets full credit

258
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,859
because there are no alternate paths, for
example between B and D, the only way they

259
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:44,238
can reach other is through C.
If we go back to the butterfly network,

260
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:50,382
remember this central node has degree two
Now it has the highest between, as it said

261
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:56,068
between this nine because each of these
nodes relies on the center node in order

262
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:59,075
to reach the other three nodes in the
network.

263
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:04,499
On the other hand, these peripheral nodes
here have between a zero because, you know

264
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:09,270
you wouldn't go out of your way in order
to reach any of the other nodes.

265
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,800
They, there are, they are on those
shortest paths.

266
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:20,993
Let's look at this particular toy network.
Here C and D each have between this one.

267
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:26,885
How do you calculate that?
Well, c is on a path from a and b to e,

268
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,649
and so is d.
So imagine first that d is not there.

269
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:35,105
Well, if that were the case then c would
have between this too.

270
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:39,920
Because it's on the path room a to e and
then the path room b to e.

271
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,598
However d is on the exact same path.
And so they share credit and they each get

272
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:51,740
between this one Quiz question, what is
the betweeness of node E?

273
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,996
Here's, an, older version of my Facebook
network.

274
00:22:55,996 --> 00:23:00,962
I've sized the nodes by degree.
The, larger the size, the higher the

275
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,273
degree.
And I've colored them by betweenness.

276
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:07,810
The redder the node, the higher the
betweenness.

277
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:14,056
And you can see some nodes here that have,
relatively low degree, but they have high

278
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:19,549
betweenness because they bridge, for
example, my, undergrad network, with my

279
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:22,860
University of Michigan and research,
network.

280
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,460
Another quiz question, find a node that
has high betweeness, but low degree.

281
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,660
And now, find a node that has low
betweeness but high degree.

282
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,588
What if it's not so important to have so
many direct trends?

283
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:49,146
So doesn't matter whether you want to do
this power play where you're brokering

284
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:55,121
between different parts of the network and
you want to make sure that they have to go

285
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:59,012
through you.
What if instead all you want is that you

286
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:01,904
have.
Easy access to a large part of the

287
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:05,322
network.
You want information to reach you in a

288
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:11,212
short number of hops, you want to be able
to disseminate the information you have.

289
00:24:11,212 --> 00:24:17,247
Therefore it's not about brokerage, it's
about how far away the rest of the network

290
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,953
is from you.
For example, in this network, this node

291
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:26,919
has degree one but because it's friends
with the highest degree node this means

292
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:33,184
that the number of hops from it to anyone
else in the network is only one extra hop

293
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:39,001
then it is for the most central node.
And in fact has easy access through just

294
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:44,197
that single connection, so.
We want to capture this no, notion of a

295
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:49,291
small number of hops.
So by definition, the closest centrality

296
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:55,890
is the sum of the distances between the
note in question I, and all other notes.

297
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,625
[inaudible] it's J.
And you're going to sum these distances

298
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,044
and invert them.
Now, there's a problem in that, if your

299
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:07,792
node has multiple connected components.
That is, there are nodes in other

300
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:11,338
components than yours, your distance to
them is infinite.

301
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:16,150
And when you sum infinity with other
things, it means your, your closeness is

302
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,416
actually zero.
Right?

303
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:21,911
Because here, you're inverting.
So in order to avoid that, an alternative

304
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:26,027
measure of closeness is to take this
inversion inside of the sum.

305
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:30,723
And so you take the inverse of.
The distance to every other node, and you

306
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:31,990
sum those value.
So.

307
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,207
All those nodes and other components, they
just contribute zero to your closeness

308
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:42,359
and, but you do get credit for having
short paths to nodes that are in your same

309
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,709
component.
And you can normalize this by n minus one,

310
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:52,300
the number of other nodes in the network.
Here is a toy example where if we look at

311
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:59,919
the closeness of A, it has distance one to
B, distance two to C, three to D, four to

312
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,870
E.
We sum those, we divide by n-1 and we

313
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:09,669
invert getting a closeness of.4.
Finally we can also look at our other toy

314
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,720
network and here again the middle node has
high closeness.

315
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,837
The ones right next to it also have
relatively high closeness.

316
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:22,817
Here the middle node has high closeness
but the other nodes being directly

317
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:27,865
connected to this hub, that is the spokes
they actually have relatively high

318
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:32,247
closeness as, as well.
They're only two hops away from any other

319
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:36,571
node.
So looking at this network, can you tell

320
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:41,044
me which node has relatively high degree
but low closeness?
