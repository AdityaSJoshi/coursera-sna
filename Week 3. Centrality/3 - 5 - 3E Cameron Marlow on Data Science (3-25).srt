For our next short video segment, it's my
pleasure to introduce Cameron Marlow, who

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,811
is the head of the data science team at
Facebook.

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,230
Hi.
And so the first question to you is how

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,320
did you first get into social network
analysis?

5
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:20,910
I first got into social network analysis
by taking a course with Keith Hampton,

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,658
At MIT on social network analysis.
It was an introductory course in 2001.

7
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,554
And it was the, frankly I think the best
course of my life.

8
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:33,328
I don't know if it was the subject matter,
the teacher or both.

9
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:37,894
But ever since then I've been interested
in studying social networks.

10
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:40,302
So That's where I got my start.
Cool.

11
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:44,914
And so then, you started applying it, but
not immediately at Facebook.

12
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,356
Mm.
So what was the path there?

13
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,730
What was the path?
So, yeah.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,121
So I've always been interested in social
networks.

15
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:57,666
But, you know, it's difficult to measure,
measure them.

16
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,600
So, you know, one, source of data has
always been the web.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,685
And so, I've always been interested in, in
sort of extracting social networks from,

18
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:12,255
from different social media and online
communities, so I studied web blogs for my

19
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:15,828
for my PhD thesis.
And went on to Yahoo research where I

20
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:20,732
studied communities such as Flickr and
Delicious, but I really like was attracted

21
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:25,757
to come to Facebook because here the
social norms, the site have produced a, a

22
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:30,540
network which very closely resembles the
real, sort of the real social network of,

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,567
of humans.
So, a lot of the work that we do here, we

24
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:36,460
can.
We can sort of ex-, extrapolate, you know,

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,370
more general phenomena about how human
social networks work.

26
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:45,727
Okay, so can you extend a little bit on
that, what role does the social network

27
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:49,181
play at Facebook,
How it operates. so its hard to under,

28
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:56,024
estimate the importance of social networks
in the way that people at Facebook think.

29
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:59,064
So,
I would say that I was unique in my

30
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:04,744
research and the people that I interacted
with when, I was at, you know, at, at

31
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:08,626
Yahoo Research.
But here, everyone really thinks and

32
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:14,810
operates on, concepts of social networks.
So just to give an example, You know, the

33
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,921
way that we fundamentally store data here,
and, and access it for, like, all parts of

34
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:26,846
the, the site are, You know is as a graph.
So, most, most of Facebook's data is,

35
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:32,730
represented as nodes and edges in, in a
very large, graph of people and, and

36
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,892
objects.
And, and, and, conversations.

37
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:40,600
So, that, you know, it's sort of part of
everyone's everyday life.

38
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:45,108
You know, and, and some of the social
network concepts that you deal with, in,

39
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:48,949
in courses like, a lot has come up you
know, in, in every day work.

40
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:53,180
So, you know, this idea that the degree
distribution has a very high variance.

41
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,798
And there are some people with, like, lots
and lots of connections.

42
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:59,692
And like, most people have, you know, some
connections.

43
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,201
You can't really build a service, you
know, or you can't really build a, a

44
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:07,668
product in Facebook without.
Taking this into to account.

45
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:12,531
Because some of your users are just going
to have such an enormously different

46
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:18,256
experience with their 5,000 friends, which
we sometimes call whales here, than the

47
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:21,150
average user that has 150 or, or 200
friends.

48
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:21,929
Okay.
Yeah.

49
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:22,806
Thanks.
Sure.

50
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,974
I guess that's, that, and stay tuned for
more of these clips.

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,435
Yeah.
Thanks Cameron.
