1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,566
When you look at a real world network such
as my facebook network its clear that the

2
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:10,740
nodes with high closeness are close to
other nodes with high closeness that is

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,045
they are kind of in the middle in the
thick of things and in general we may want

4
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:21,153
a definition of closeness a separate
centrality measure which we are going to

5
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:24,690
call eigenvector centrality which sells
that you are.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,464
As important as your neighbors are.
And your neighbors are as important as

7
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:33,270
their neighbors are.
So it's this nice recursive definition.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,173
So if we have node I, and we have its
neighbors and the weights of the edges.

9
00:00:38,173 --> 00:00:43,399
Then the importance of I is going to be
the sum of these kinds of terms, where we

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,593
take the weight of that edge.
And, you know, normally, it's, it's one,

11
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:53,141
But you can use weighted networks as well.
 whatever the centrality of that node is.

12
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:58,367
And you may iterate this many, many times.
Because, of course, as you're calculating

13
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,902
this.
Centrality for I its going to actually now

14
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:08,177
affect the centrality of K etc and this is
precisely the problem of solving for the

15
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:14,154
eigenvector of the adjacent signature X
with eigen value one and thats why its

16
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:18,713
called eigen vector centrality.
One of the first people to apply

17
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:22,657
eigenvector's centrality to social
networks was Bonachich.

18
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:26,668
He wasn't happy with just, you know, the
plane agency matrix.

19
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:31,700
He wanted a parameter that he could vary,
and he chose this parameter beta.

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,120
And what beta does is it says, "How
important it is, is it, that your."

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,722
Neighbours are important versus just how
many neighbours you have.

22
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:48,533
So, he was able to tune that.
And this paramether alpha here, is just a

23
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:53,205
normalization constant.
So, you have that this entrallity of node

24
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:58,783
I, for a certain paramether beta, is the
sum over all of its neighbours, which you

25
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:04,013
are going to get from, from this.
The adjacency matrix is, can be weighted

26
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:04,990
or not.
And.

27
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:10,453
For each of those neighbors you're going
to have this factor of alpha plus beta

28
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:13,875
times the eigenvector centrality of the
neighbor.

29
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:19,009
And this can be solved through a matrix
computation to derive the eigenvector

30
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:24,012
centrality scores for all the nodes.
Now you don't have to sit there and, you

31
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:27,698
know, calculate this by hand, that could
get really hairy.

32
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:33,753
Naturally, you know, a lot of software can
calculate these, these kinds of things for

33
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,781
you, but it's good to know where it comes
from.

34
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,843
What the, what the idea be.
Kind having such, su such a centrality

35
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,853
measure is.
And so, if you have small beta, what

36
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:49,737
happens is, you know, beta close to zero.
Is that only your immediate friends are

37
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,260
going to matter.
So it's going to be, how many friends you

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,391
have as opposed to how important they are.
Because their importance is derived from

39
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:03,090
the structure of the wider network.
If you have high beta, you're going to

40
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,108
have low attenuation.
Meaning that, all of those multiple steps

41
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:11,620
are going to be quite important.
It's not just how important your friends

42
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,402
are, but also how important their friends
are.

43
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:21,440
The friends of friends of friends,
Etc. And in the case that beta is zero,

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:29,420
you're just recovering the, the degree
centrality because all you have is the sum

45
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:37,830
of the edges for a note.
The interesting thing that Bonacich

46
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,325
started examining was what happens if beta
is actually negative?

47
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:49,850
So when Beta is positive The centrality
follows the intuition I said, which is

48
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,774
that.
Having neighbors who are themselves

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:57,330
important, makes you important.
However, if beta is negative, nodes have

50
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,282
higher centrality when they're connected
to actually less central nodes.

51
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:07,828
So let's see if this made sense to you.
Take a look at these two networks, and try

52
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:12,714
to figure out which one has beta positive,
and which one has beta negative.

53
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:17,798
So far, with the exception of degree,
where we had in-degree and out-degree, we

54
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,033
were talking primarily about undirected
networks.

55
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:24,190
And, I just want.
Want to take a little bit of time to talk

56
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,670
about centrality and directive matter.
.

57
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,420
There naturally are many different
directed networks.

58
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,100
For example, the World Wide Web.
And we mentioned how.

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,892
You know, the meaning of out degree, how
many different pages a page points to is

60
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:46,249
really different from the meaning of in
degree, how many pages point to it.

61
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:51,896
So, out degree just indicates okay, is
this page referencing a lot of different

62
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,200
content.
In degree.

63
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,570
Is a signal of how many other people found
that content relevant enough so to link to

64
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,936
that page from their page.
Foodweb's naturally directed right.

65
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,014
The wolf leads the sheep.
Not visa versa.

66
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,595
Population dynamics where individuals
migrate right.

67
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:15,389
Migration patterns are usually directed.
Influence.

68
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:21,473
How much you influence someone is probably
different from how much they influence

69
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:24,694
you.
And it depends on your relative prestige

70
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:28,128
and the nature of the relationship.
Relationship.

71
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:34,483
Hereditary networks, citation networks,
biological networks, such as transcription

72
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:38,554
regulation networks, or neural networks
are also directed.

73
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:44,195
And it makes a lot sense if you have a
task to do then some nodes are going to

74
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:49,051
effect the behavior of other nodes and the
network it's directed.

75
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:53,550
Undirected you know, things would be just
firing back and forth.

76
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,377
Some of the measures are just naturally
extended into their directed counterparts.

77
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:06,179
So if you remember when we talked about
betweenness this was simply the number of

78
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:11,776
paths between all the other pairs of nodes
that pass through our node of interest

79
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:15,052
divided by the total number of paths pairs
have.

80
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:20,240
And what we're going to do we're just
going to change it we're going to say

81
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,950
instead of undirected paths these are
going to be directed paths and.

82
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,950
And when we normalize, we're going to
have, here.

83
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:36,402
N - one x N - two And we're going to lose
that factor of two, because getting from A

84
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:40,749
to B can in fact be.
Or actually here from K to G can be

85
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:47,531
different than getting back to K from J.
Right so, we do need to take into account

86
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:53,798
the directionality of the path, but pretty
much directed between as follows it's

87
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:58,413
undirected counterpart.
Same thing with closeness centrality, you

88
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:03,422
can talk about in closeness or out
closeness and typically you will only

89
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:08,705
consider vertices that are reachable.
So this is kind of getting, cuz once you

90
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:14,195
have a directed network it's even more
difficult for everything to be connected

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,410
cuz if you have the same number of edges
and they're directed you, you.

92
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:24,217
Here in fact and you can only traverse
them in one direction right.

93
00:07:24,217 --> 00:07:29,598
You have about half the number of edges.
So perhaps you're only calculating

94
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:36,198
closeness forward from the reachable nodes
and here you, you know, you have the kind

95
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:40,862
of input domain are going to be all the
nodes that can reach you.

96
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:46,745
And the question is going to be how many
hops does it take and kind of the output

97
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:50,548
domain are all the nodes reach in outward
fashion.

98
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:55,840
So then again um..
It's very easily extended, where.

99
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,913
Things get really I don't know if, if
interesting is the right word, but where

100
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:11,802
there is a really a big, game change when,
when you added directionality to

101
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:17,172
eigenvector centrality.
And this was applied by Larry Page and

102
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:23,015
Sergey Brin when they were graduate
students at Stanford to the web.

103
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:29,491
They just said we're going to figure out
how important each web page is and we're

104
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:35,014
not going to take just the, The number of
other pages that point to it.

105
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:40,589
We're going to instead look at the
importance of those pages in a recursive

106
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,523
way.
And so, for example, here, at least at

107
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:49,392
that time, Slashdot was really important.
Lots and lots of other pages pointed to

108
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:53,395
it.
So it's enough for Slashdot, to link to

109
00:08:53,395 --> 00:09:00,995
mention another page and oftentimes that
web server would just be brought down from

110
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:08,234
all the traffic and attention that would
ensue and so we really want to capture

111
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:12,396
this.
It's not just random web pages that link

112
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:17,463
to you but whether those pages themselves
are important.

113
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:23,581
Now there's a, there's an analogy here,
which is that when you're calculating this

114
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:27,273
eigenvector it's as if you're doing a
random walk.

115
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:33,066
And so I like to think of it as a drunk,
who's kind of like wandering around, and

116
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:39,293
every time he hits a node, he says, oop, ,
okay, I'm just going to turn left, and,

117
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,637
turn right, and so, he's just following,
edges at random.

118
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:50,081
And what page rank being, the amount of
time that he is going to spend at each

119
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:56,221
node, What it.
Then corresponds to is the eigenvector of,

120
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:02,752
of the adjacency matrix.
But, there's a very important tweak.

121
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:06,724
If this.
Network, say the web was undirected.

122
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:13,650
The drunk could just kinda, you know go
and then just go back the same way if he

123
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:20,419
gets stuck somewhere but when the network
is directed, he can only follow the edges

124
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:26,951
in a certain direction, meaning that here,
if there is a cycle of this sort, he would

125
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:32,932
just be trapped and circling here
indefinitely which then means that you

126
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:37,970
actually can't compute the eigenvector,
right because the, the.

127
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,571
You're a random walker, you're drug is
actually being absorbed in, in different

128
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:47,907
parts of the network.
So the very cool insight that, these two

129
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:53,815
guys, Page and Brinn had was to allow for
random teleportation.

130
00:10:54,101 --> 00:11:01,820
Which is that with some probability the
drunk is going to follow an edge when he

131
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,156
arrives at a node.
But with 1- that probabilty, he's just

132
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:11,730
going to teleport to a random node in the
graph.

133
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,400
And this solves the problem of getting
stuck and.

134
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,642
But it still captures this, you know the,
the important pages are the ones that are

135
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:30,293
linked to by important pages, so great.
So let's see what this would look like on

136
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:35,494
a simple toy network.
Let's see the random walker starts at node

137
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,037
one.
At the next step he, with, you know some

138
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:45,883
substantial probability will go to either
seven or eight, but we also have a twenty%

139
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:52,730
teleportation probability which means that
the 80% of going to seven and eight will

140
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,308
be evenly split between them so.
If we start out with you know, ten units

141
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:03,745
to distribute we get four each at seven
and eight but we also distributed

142
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:07,639
twenty percent evenly among all the nodes
including node one.

143
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,444
And so after the first step we have most
of the probability being at seven and

144
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:18,220
eight but also he could have teleported
elsewhere in the network.

145
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:26,590
If we go on and look at what happens after
ten steps you find that.

146
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,935
You know, there is a lot of probability
around seven.

147
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:37,703
And this indeed makes sense because seven
not only has high indegree but some of

148
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:44,138
those nodes like two and five and six
actually have other nodes feeding into

149
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,065
them.
And so recursively seven should have high

150
00:12:48,065 --> 00:12:52,244
paytrank.
To check your understanding, I would like

151
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:58,816
you to go to this paytrenk demo where you
will be moving a slider to Adjust the

152
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:03,145
teleportation probability, and then you're
going to iterate.

153
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:08,573
So you're going to distribute the
probability, kind of like with each step

154
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:13,709
that the random walker might take.
And then I'd like you to figure out

155
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:20,550
whether higher or lower teleportation
probability leads to more equal or less

156
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,140
equal distribution of page ranks
centrality scores.

157
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,363
Just to wrap up for now.
We've seen lots and lots of definitions of

158
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:33,287
different centrality values.
We had degree.

159
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,793
We had betweenness.
We had closeness.

160
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:40,665
We had Iconfactory centrality.
And we even had sort of network wide

161
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:45,468
measures of centralization.
Does everyone have approximately the same

162
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:50,341
degree or is it really scute.
We extended this to directed networks.

163
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:58,137
To see, you know, when, when direction
matters, how do these centrality measures

164
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,866
translate and.
What might be missing from all of this

165
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:07,900
actually is an understanding of, you know,
what is this good for?

166
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,254
I mean sometimes it's true.
It's just nice to look at a network and

167
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:19,406
say, oh, here are the central nodes.
For example you can do this with the Enron

168
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:26,118
email network that was released, as part
of the court proceedings, and, you know,

169
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:32,431
you can, you can infer who the top level
management was simply because of their

170
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:36,493
high centrality.
Trivial because you know sometimes the

171
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:42,346
very top people don't email the most.
Sometimes the people who are very central

172
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:47,985
are the ones who kind of handle email on
their behalf or in charge of their

173
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:53,410
calender, so there are lots of interesting
things to explore if you wanna do

174
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,288
exploratory data analysis.
But, if you are Oh and I should say, in

175
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:05,977
the assignment you'll be looking at
actually a court case network.

176
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:13,873
And this is an anti trust case where
several turbine and other kind of powered

177
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:20,933
generator equipment manufacturers were
accused of basically colluding.

178
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:26,042
Doing price setting.
And the question is how does an

179
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,648
individual's.
Position in this collusion network

180
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:34,515
correlate with their probability of, or
actually their, their outcome.

181
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:39,724
That is, whether they were convicted or
not and how heavy their sentence was.

182
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:44,795
So that's kind of cool, right?
If you could ahead of time figure out how

183
00:15:44,795 --> 00:15:47,948
things will play out for a conspiracy
network.

184
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:54,185
The other paper that you'll be looking at
is well it's this remarkable data set that

185
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:59,737
Sinan Aral and Marshall VanAlstyne
collected of personnel in a headhunting

186
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,863
firm.
And, what they discovered was that it

187
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:08,731
didn't matter how fat your rolodex is, its
how many peoples addresses you know.

188
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:15,277
That it's in fact your positioning in the
network, the diversity of your contacts,

189
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:21,220
having less constraints, that correlates
both with your performance, that is how

190
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:27,389
much money you bring into the company, and
interestingly with the information that

191
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:31,452
reaches you.
Whether you find out new information more

192
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:36,895
quickly than your colleagues do.
I hope that those two papers which will be

193
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,799
part of your assignment, will be
interesting.

194
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,475
And in the next video what I'll do is just
talk about some research I've done and how

195
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:49,501
I've made use of centrality measures in a
very practical way.
