1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,382
Welcome to week two of Social Network
Analysis.

2
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:08,902
This is the Les Matty version of Network
modeling.

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:13,236
Why do we want to model networks?
Because we want to understand the

4
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:17,459
underlying dynamics that leads to the
observed structures.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,740
So for example, last week we looked at
several networks.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,533
And observed some interesting
characteristics.

7
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:31,074
We thought we understood how girls in a
dormitory choose their dining table

8
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:35,577
partners.
However, knowing particular values that we

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:40,997
measure for one network does not mean that
if we go to another dorm.

10
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:46,116
We can predict what those values will be
for the other setting.

11
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:52,102
But if we have an underlying model that
tells us well these are the motivations

12
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:57,450
for the edge formation in that network.
Then we may very well be able to

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,468
generalize and make predictions about
networks we haven't even yet observed.

14
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,674
Well this is all nice.
Assuming that your model is actually a

15
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:15,404
good representation.
Now, how can you tell that your model is

16
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:18,964
valid?
Well, what you're going to do is you're

17
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:22,501
going to generate, either through
simulation.

18
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:28,108
Which is what we'll be doing with net logo
or you can derive mathematically,

19
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:34,249
properties of networks that follow the
dynamics and the assumptions that you make

20
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:37,875
in the model.
And if those values agree, if your

21
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:44,175
prediction based on the model agrees with
the observed quantities, then your model

22
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:47,946
is a good one.
However If your model fails to predict

23
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:53,700
some features, but, then you know that
perhaps there's rooms for improvement.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,806
Maybe there are additional characteristics
that need to be incorporated into the

25
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:03,570
model.
So, for example, if in the dining table

26
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,054
partner networks that you observe.
You see that some girls have many more

27
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:16,780
incoming edges than others.
If your model is that partners are chosen

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,464
at random, you may or may not be able to
reproduce that observed degree

29
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:28,694
distribution of some girls having Higher
much higher degree than others.

30
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:33,702
So in that case you may need to
incorporate additional features in to your

31
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:39,114
model for example that some girls are
intrinsically more, more desirable as

32
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:45,219
dining table partners than others are.
Or there may be other mechanisms that can

33
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:51,843
lead to this discrepancy or dispersion in
the degree distribution and we will talk

34
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:59,622
about some of those models this week.
First, let's talk about the most essential

35
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:06,277
Model of networks and this is the
Erds-Renyi random graph.

36
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:08,635
First let me tell you about Erds and
Renyi.

37
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:14,080
Erds is very famous mathematician who was
extremely prolific [laugh].

38
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:19,639
Wrote I think hundreds of papers.
And the way in which he wrote them was he

39
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,240
would travel from one mathematicians
doorstep to the next.

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,730
And when he arrive, he would say, my mind
is open, let's work together.

41
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,978
And after writing a paper or two with that
person he would go on to the next.

42
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:43,107
And, this as you might imagine.
It meant that in the co-authorship network

43
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:49,261
Erdos had an extremely high degree.
And in fact, if you look at the whole

44
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:55,010
network, there is, it's, it's a matter of
prestige what your Erdos number is.

45
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,750
Your Edros number is one, if you directly
co-authored with Erdos.

46
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,061
Its two if you co-authored with someone
who then co-authored with Erdos.

47
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,002
Three, etcetera.
Mine, mine incidentally is four, and there

48
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:10,093
are lots and lots of people who have an
Erdos numb-, number of four.

49
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:14,406
It's not it's not a, a very prestigious
number at all.

50
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:20,202
But, by being so productive, actually
Erdos ends up being the center of this

51
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:25,142
very large network.
Now, one of his favorite collaborators is

52
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:28,742
Renyi.
Renyi is credited with the quote that

53
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:33,750
mathematicians are machines who turn
coffee into theorems.

54
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,262
Together they wrote a series of papers on
the properties of the random graph which

55
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:44,100
in this course, and in general, is called
an Erdos-Renyi random graph.

56
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,220
Now, let's look at What the assumptions of
this model are.

57
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,358
There are very few its just going to be
that the nodes are going to connect at

58
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,928
random.
So any two nodes in the network are

59
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:02,416
equally likely to connect, the network is
going to be undirected so unlike the

60
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,209
dining table partners where you had one
girl.

61
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,880
Picking another as her favorite but this
not being reciprocated.

62
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,332
Here the edges are undirected and the last
assumption or the last parameter is what

63
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:20,730
the probability is of any two nodes
connecting.

64
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,115
We'll call this probability P.
So for example, any two individuals might

65
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:31,344
have a probability of .1 of having an
edge, meaning that 1 out of 10 edges that

66
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:36,745
could exist in the network, actually do.
Alternatively, what you can do is specify

67
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:44,020
the total number of edges in the network.
We'll call this M and then allocate those

68
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,476
randomly among all pairs of nodes.
Now what does a Erds-Renyi network look

69
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:54,177
like?
Here I've taken 20 nodes and I've added

70
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:58,520
some edges at random.
To connect them, the very definition of an

71
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,115
Erdos-Renyi random graph.
Last week, I said that if you apply a

72
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:06,735
spring layout algorithm to a network to
reposition the nodes, placing the ones

73
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:11,076
that share an edge close together.
This can reveal some of the underlying

74
00:06:11,076 --> 00:06:15,269
structure, like hopefully you saw with the
your or my Facebook network.

75
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,468
Right?
You should have seen interesting

76
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:21,956
communities, however, by definition the
Erds-Renyi random graph doesn't have

77
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:25,820
interesting structure hidden, because the
connections are random.

78
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,482
So, typically when you look at such
network you're going to see a hairball.

79
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:33,292
Here it's a small hairball.
Larger networks you see a larger hairball.

80
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:38,448
But one thing that is clear and elegant is
the degree distribution which you can

81
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:42,641
derive mathematically.
And I, I show this in greater detail in

82
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:46,059
the math version of this lecture but
basically.

83
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,600
Each node is going to look at n minus one
other nodes in the network and its going

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,172
to flip a biased coin.
With probability p its going to have an

85
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:57,854
edge to that other node with probability
one minus p it won't.

86
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:03,135
And we have then the degree distribution
which tells us for every degree what is

87
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:06,550
the probability.
That a node has this given degree.

88
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,032
And as we increase the probability from 5
to 20%.

89
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:16,165
We can see the degree distribution
shifting to the right.

90
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:23,148
That is the higher the probability of
adding an edge, the higher the degree Is

91
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:28,997
that a node is likely to have.
And this binomial distribution then is

92
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:35,828
very well approximated by the Poisson, as
long as you have a large-ish network, and

93
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:41,364
the value of P isn't too, too high.
Now, let's look at a net logo simulation

94
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:47,114
of the Erdos-Renyi random graph.
As I discussed already, there are just a

95
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:50,456
few parameters to set.
We have the number of nodes.

96
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:55,292
Here, I've chosen 200 nodes.
And we can decide whether we want to set

97
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,762
the probability of any 2 nodes being
connected.

98
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:01,778
Or the average number of edges or number
of neighbors per node.

99
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:06,319
Here, I'm going to select the probability.
And I used this slider to adjust the

100
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,339
probability, starting out with just a .2
percent probability of any two nodes being

101
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,730
connected in this 200-node graph.
I click the link.

102
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,804
I can do the layout.
And what we see here at average degree 0.3

103
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:26,730
is that we have many, many isolated nodes.
So, degree 0 is the most common degree.

104
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,330
And a few dyads.
Even one node having three neighbors.

105
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,870
Let's see what happens as we up this
probability.

106
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,338
Maybe to 0.5%.
Now we see that the components are

107
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:47,356
growing.
We can increase this further maybe to 1%.

108
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:53,570
And we can observe what happens to the
average degree let's just pick one more

109
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,756
value, maybe 2%.
And we should be seeing a denser and

110
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:02,795
denser network.
You, you can try and tease this apart a

111
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:07,231
little bit by adjusting the spring length
and upping the repulsion force.

112
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:11,278
Just to see a little bit more of the
internal structure however these

113
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,680
Erdos-Renyi random graphs once they're
dense enough, really do look like

114
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,530
hairballs.
What the degree distribution tells us is

115
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,623
how evenly distributed the edges are among
the nodes.

116
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:29,171
What is the probability that a node has
degree 0, degree 1, degree 2?

117
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:32,792
And all of those probabilities have to sum
to 1.

118
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:37,648
And by looking at the shape of that
distribution, we can tell whether nodes

119
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:42,190
tend to have approximately the same degree
with some random variation.

120
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,789
Or whether perhaps there are some outliers
that have degree much higher than others.

121
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:56,050
So to test your understanding, if you have
a network of size N, meaning they are N

122
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,658
nodes.
Any one node can have a maximum of N, N

123
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:05,560
minus 1, or N over 2 edges.
And just assume that this is a simple

124
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,524
graph, meaning that there aren't multiple
edges allowed between the same pair of

125
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:17,302
nodes.
Now that maximal degree, which is

126
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:24,386
incidentally N minus 1, is not often
achieved in an Erdos-Renyi model.

127
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:31,774
If you have some moderate probability of
edges between the nodes here we'll set it

128
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:37,494
to 20% in a network of 50 nodes.
What you'll see is that there is some

129
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:44,704
variation in degree but the maximum degree
16 is not that different from the average

130
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:49,549
degree of 10.
And its nowhere close to 49, the act-, the

131
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:54,857
actual maximum degree.
Now, of course, we can vary the parameter,

132
00:10:54,857 --> 00:11:00,902
so we can up that probability to be 0.9;
that is, 90% of pairs of individuals are

133
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:06,005
acquainted in this network.
And now you do have several individuals

134
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:11,660
having the maximal degree, but that
maximal degree is not that different from

135
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,688
the average.
So in an Erdos-Renyi random graph, the

136
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:19,380
degrees of the nodes tend to be pretty
similar.

137
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:27,252
You don't have one node having degree 49,
and we might call that node a hub, and

138
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:33,820
everyone else having degree 1 or 2.
So to further deepen your understanding

139
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,857
I'd like you to.
Figure out what the approximate average

140
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:45,892
degree of a graph with 100 nodes is where
the probability of any two nodes sharing

141
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:50,725
an edge is .04.
And I just want the approximate value is

142
00:11:50,725 --> 00:12:01,903
it one, two, three or four?
And one final quiz for this segment.

143
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:07,454
Going back to the NetLogo model, I would
like you to pick some probability of two

144
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:12,716
nodes sharing an edge and you can.
It's your choice, but I'd like you to keep

145
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:16,996
it constant and then I'd like you to vary
the number of nodes.

146
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:23,768
Starting with a small network, generating
that network, and then increasing the size

147
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:29,449
of the network, the number nodes.
While the probability stays constant and

148
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:35,334
then answering the following question.
Does the average degree stay the same?

149
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:43,660
Increase or decrease?
What insights did this exploration of the

150
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,945
ErdsRnyi random graphs yield?
Well, we saw some things which we will

151
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:54,363
delve into further about when the degree
is, the average degree is very low,

152
00:12:54,363 --> 00:13:00,262
observing many disconnected components.
We also saw the absence of hubs.

153
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:06,356
The ErdsRnyi random graph does not yield
networks where some nodes are very well

154
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:12,110
