1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,013
Hello.
Welcome to week two of Social Network

2
00:00:03,013 --> 00:00:06,062
Analysis.
This week we'll be focusing on modeling

3
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:10,054
social networks.
Now why would you want to model social

4
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:14,024
networks?
Just last week we showed how you can learn

5
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:19,080
many interesting things just by analyzing
the network structure of real world

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,094
networks.
What good is a model?

7
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:27,026
Well a model is going to be a simple
representation of that real world complex

8
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:32,073
network and it's going to allow you to
test certain assumptions because in order

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:38,019
to formulate your model you have implement
those assumptions and see whether the

10
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,066
network that is generated from your model
in any way resembles the real world

11
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:48,018
network that you're seeing.
So for example if you were looking at a

12
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:52,642
social network and you discovered that
some people had many more friends than

13
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:55,386
others.
You could say oh, well I think that.

14
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:58,975
What's leading to this is just a random
fluctuation.

15
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:04,470
So people meet and form edges at random
and some people are going to have more

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,010
edges and some people are going to have
fewer edges and that's my model.

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,023
It's going to be a completely random graph
model.

18
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:15,036
Well, what happens next is that you can
test this.

19
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:20,054
You can generate networks according to
your model and see if indeed you get some

20
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:23,079
individuals who have many more friends
than others.

21
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,145
If this doesn't happen you know if your
model can't reproduce the, the

22
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:33,011
distribution of degrees that you see in
the real network, well, that means that

23
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:37,169
your model needs to be adjusted.
That the way you're thinking about the

24
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:41,838
world and the way that friendship
formation functions is actually not, not

25
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,866
what you thought.
Your model needs to be extended.

26
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:48,586
These kinds of models also often just
serve as a straw man.

27
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:51,699
Right?
So you know that the model, it's not, it's

28
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:55,393
not realistic, right?
People don't just meet at random but you'd

29
00:01:55,393 --> 00:02:00,504
like to know exactly how your network is
different from such a random network, and

30
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:05,779
that gives you further insight about the
measurements that you're taking on your

31
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:09,069
real world network.
Because, if your real world network is

32
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,691
looking very similar to the, to say, a
random graph model, you can see, there's

33
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:18,227
not much interest in going on, here.
But if it looks very different, if the

34
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:22,879
number Numbers you get from the model
versus the numbers you get in your real

35
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,847
network are very divergent then you can
say uh-huh, this an interesting feature

36
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:32,062
of, of my real world network, and that is
what I will pursue further.

37
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:38,009
This very basic network model was first
formulated by Erdos and Renyi.

38
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,850
They're two Hungarian mathematicians,
Erdos was an eccentric.

39
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,064
He was very, very productive.
He traveled from conference to conference,

40
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:52,581
from one collaborator's door to the next,
saying, my mind is open, let's write some

41
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,814
papers.
And after he would finish the papers he

42
00:02:55,814 --> 00:03:00,474
would move on to the next place.
There's actually a network, of coauthors

43
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:06,090
that it's prestigious to be close to Erdos
and so if you have an Erdos number of one,

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,065
it means you are one of his many, many
direct collaborators.

45
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:15,041
If you have an Erdos number of two, it
means you are a collaborator of a

46
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,096
collaborator.
So people like to calculate their Erdos

47
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:21,088
number.
Mine is four by the way, which isn't

48
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:26,014
impressive at all.
He collaborated a lot with Renyi, who, is

49
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:31,099
actually credited with the quote,
mathematicians are just machines that, who

50
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:37,044
turn coffee into theorems.
He and Erdos were very, productive, and

51
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:43,060
among their 32 publications are several
well known ones on the Erdos and Renyi

52
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,037
random graph model, where they could
exactly derive a lot of results about

53
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:54,066
precisely this model of a network where
you connect nodes at random.

54
00:03:56,016 --> 00:04:01,091
There basically very few assumptions here
besides the size of the network, the

55
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:06,027
number of nodes.
You just have the probability that any two

56
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:09,066
nodes are connected.
This is the probability P.

57
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:15,033
An alternative formulation is that you
determine the total number of edges, M.

58
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:20,094
And, the mathematical treatment is a
little bit more difficult in the second

59
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,003
case.
And in any case, the two formulations

60
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:27,043
become very similar once the network is
large.

61
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:32,033
So we'll focus on the first one, where
you're just fixing the probability that

62
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:36,044
any two nodes are connected.
What do these networks look like?

63
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:41,079
Here, I've laid out the nodes on a circle.
Just, I think it's twenty nodes.

64
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,013
And I've added some edges at random.
As we learned last week, sometimes a

65
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:53,025
layout is more effective if nodes that are
directly connected are close to each other

66
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:58,031
in the layout, so I applied a spring
layout algorithm, and got this very

67
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,094
typical shape of, of an Erdos-Renyi random
graph.

68
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:06,573
The first thing that we can derive for
the, Erdos-Renyi random graph is its

69
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:11,071
degree distribution.
This tells us how many nodes in the

70
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:15,495
network have no neighbors?
How many of them have one neighbor?

71
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:18,467
How many of them have two neighbors,
etcetera?

72
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,007
It's going to get a little bit
mathematical.

73
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:26,328
But if you've ever had basic probability
and statistics, you recognize the binomial

74
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,326
distribution.
This is all it is.

75
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:31,949
And, if you've never had, this level of
math, don't worry.

76
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,832
It's not, what I'm going to say, you can
also build just through intuition and

77
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:41,568
through playing with the demo.
So it's not that you have to derive the

78
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:44,916
binomial distribution from scratch or
anything like that.

79
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:50,527
I'm bringing it in more just to show, hey,
if you're a mathematician, there's a whole

80
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:56,024
lot of interesting things and properties
you can derive about networks.

81
00:05:56,024 --> 00:06:01,021
And actually I, I'm just going to be
scratching the, the surface of that.

82
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:06,031
So that, that is the, the goal.
To illustrate how you can intuit some

83
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:10,001
properties when you have a nice model of
the network.

84
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:16,081
So, again our model is we have N nodes
and, with probability P, we add an edge

85
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:22,081
between every pair of nodes.
So we're, we're kind of flipping a coin.

86
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,042
Right?
So, one node.

87
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:27,088
Out of the N, it's going to look at the N
minus one other nodes.

88
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:32,050
And for each one it's going to flip a coin
to see whether they're going to share an

89
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,091
edge or not.
Now, to test your understanding, I'd like

90
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:40,039
you to imagine a network.
And you're keeping the probability that

91
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,080
any two nodes are connected.
The value P, you're holding constant.

92
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,035
And you're increasing the size of the
network, the number of nodes.

93
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:53,055
I want you to think about what happens to
the average degree.

94
00:06:53,055 --> 00:06:57,034
How many other nodes on average, is a node
connected to?

95
00:06:57,034 --> 00:07:01,006
To help you with this, I have created a
net logo model.

96
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,002
So let me just try and get into that
model.

97
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:09,038
And, what you're going to do is you're
going to make sure that this probability

98
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,018
or not is sent to probability.
You're going to have, you're not going to

99
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:18,079
use this number of neighbors.
You're going to fix the probability of

100
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,224
linking.
Here, I'm just made it two percent in

101
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:27,593
order to start with 100 nodes, so I'm just
going to click this Erdos-Renyi button and

102
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:32,024
maybe I'll let it lay out, just to see
what it looks like.

103
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:37,061
So let me try that a few more times and
here I see the average degree.

104
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:43,037
Now I'll increase this to maybe 300 and
generate another Erdos-Renyi random graph.

105
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,083
I'm also going to look at the average
degree.

106
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:52,081
I might do that a few more times and.
I might increase to almost 1000 nodes.

107
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:56,002
Again, generating Erdos-Renyi Random
Graph.

108
00:07:56,025 --> 00:08:00,014
Has to work a little bit harder for a
larger graph.

109
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:04,034
And then I'm going to, again, look at the
average degree.

110
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:09,000
So see if you can understand what's going
on in, in this case.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,016
Now that we've seen what these random
networks characteristically look like, we

112
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:18,020
can return to the problem of deriving the
degree distribution.

113
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,010
The degree distribution is just a
probability distribution that's going to

114
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,023
say, the probability that a node has
degree zero.

115
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:29,003
Meaning no neighbors is a certain
quantity.

116
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:34,051
The probability that it has a one is this.
The probability that it has two neighbors,

117
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:39,021
it's something else, etcetera.
So this is our, probability distribution.

118
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:42,053
And the probabilities, of course, have to
sum to one.

119
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:48,083
Back to how this might happen if we are
doing a little thought experiment is that,

120
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:54,038
the each node is looking at the n-1 other
nodes and its flipping a biased coin,

121
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:59,086
which was probability P is going to say,
link to that particular node and with

122
00:08:59,086 --> 00:09:03,045
probability 1-P is going to say uh-uh, not
that one.

123
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:08,095
And the distribution that describes this
process exactly, the coin flipping, is the

124
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,011
binomial distribution.
So what we're interested in is out of n-1

125
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,081
tries, what is the probability that k of
them are successful.

126
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:23,038
That is, what is the probability that the
node will have degree k and first we need

127
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:28,096
to know the number of different ways that
we can choose k nodes out of n minus one.

128
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:33,696
This is the binomial coefficient times the
probability that you succeeded k times,

129
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:38,078
which is p to the k times the probability
that you failed.

130
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:44,022
N minus one minus k times, which is one
minus p to the n minus one minus k.

131
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:47,039
So lets do a little bit of comprehension
here.

132
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:52,050
So, what is the maximum degree that a node
can have in a graph that has n nodes?

133
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,087
And here we're assuming that the graph is
simple, meaning that there, you can't have

134
00:09:57,087 --> 00:10:02,053
multiple edges between two nodes.
It's like two people can only have one

135
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:05,064
friendship.
They can't have two or three or four

136
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:09,436
friendships between them.
So, and this is the kind of graph that

137
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:14,668
Erdos and Renyi model random graph.
So what is the maximum degree in this

138
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:17,614
case?
Let's delve a little bit more into the

139
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:21,814
binomial distribution.
For a lot of you, this will be a review of

140
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:24,760
basic probability, but let's do it
nonetheless.

141
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,604
So imagine that you have an eight node
graph with a probability P of any two

142
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:33,655
nodes being connected.
What we'd like to know is what is the

143
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:37,586
probability that any given node is
connected to four others?

144
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:43,104
And we're going to color those blue, and
the three nodes that it's not connected to

145
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:47,975
we're going to color white.
First we need the binomial coefficient,

146
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:54,080
which is going to say what is the number
of ways you can choose four out of seven?

147
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,353
Well, you can imagine first that you can
uniquely identify all the nodes.

148
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:05,229
So that it matters whether, you know, A
goes first, B goes second, or B goes

149
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,338
first, A goes second.
Right?

150
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:11,145
And there are.
Seven factorial different ways of making

151
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:17,207
such an ordering because for the first
spot you have seven traces, for the second

152
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:22,503
spot you have the remaining six, third
spot you have remaining five etcetera.

153
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:28,079
So this is seven factorial, if you could
distinguish all of the nodes separately,

154
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,863
but what we are saying is that, we don't.
We only have, we're only distinguishing at

155
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:38,648
the level of whether a trial was
successful or not.

156
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:44,163
So whether a node is white or blue.
Which means that the three white nodes are

157
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:49,113
just completely swappable.
So our seven factorial is now divided by a

158
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:54,631
three factorial in the denominator which
is the number of different arrangements

159
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:59,579
that we now don't distinguish between.
Similarly for the nodes that we did

160
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:04,857
connect to, there are four factorial
different ways of ordering them and now we

161
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,690
don't care about their particular
ordering.

162
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,750
So we have another factor of four
factorial in the denominator.

163
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,734
So in general, this binomial coefficient
of choosing, for example here, k items out

164
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:22,995
of n-1, is going to be n-1 factorial in
the numerator, k factorial in the

165
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:27,628
denominator, N minus one minus K factorial
in the denominator as well.

166
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:31,715
And there should be.
Parenthesis around the n minus one.

167
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:35,177
Sorry about that.
So let's test our understanding.

168
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:39,952
What is the number of ways of choosing two
items out of five?

169
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:47,034
Now let's get back to the distribution.
Imagine that we have a certain way of

170
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:51,933
choosing the k out of n-1 so here it's
four out of seven.

171
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:57,194
For example, if it was white, white, blue,
blue, blue, white, blue, what we would

172
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:02,800
have for the probability of that
particular event is one minus p, times one

173
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,028
minus p, times p, times p, times p, time
one, times one minus p, times p, right?

174
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,085
So p to the fourth, times one minus p to
the third.

175
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:17,040
And once we don't care about the
particular order of white and blue, we add

176
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,760
the binomial coefficient back in.
So, in the end, the binomial distribution

177
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,395
tells us that the probability of this
particular node having degree four in our

178
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:36,210
eight node probability p graph is 72 score
P to the fourth, one - p to the third, to

179
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,073
the third.
And, that's it.

180
00:13:38,073 --> 00:13:42,073
That's how it works.
If P is equals to .5, you get, this very

181
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:48,055
symmetric looking distribution, where it's
most likely that the node will have degree

182
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:51,084
three or four.
But also, it could end up with low

183
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:57,045
probability, with no neighbors at all, or
connected to all seven of the other nodes.

184
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:02,086
If, however, the probability is only a
tenth, then you have a distribution that's

185
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:06,090
much more skewed.
It's much more likely that a node will be

186
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,001
connected to no others.
And very unlikely that it would have

187
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:16,064
anything past, degree four.
Once you have this distribution, the well

188
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:22,003
known property such as the mean, the mean
is going to give us the average degree,

189
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:27,075
from the binomial distribution we can tell
that this average degree Z is going to be

190
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,080
equal to n - one times P.
And in general if you had an arbitrary

191
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,012
degree distribution, the way that you
could calculate the mean, if you just take

192
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:43,008
the expected value which is the sum over
all the possible outcomes here, we're

193
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:48,012
interested in the degree X times the
probability of X occurring.

194
00:14:48,077 --> 00:14:53,072
To test our understanding, let's see what
the average degree would be of a graph

195
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:58,024
with ten nodes, where the probability of
any two nodes linking is a third.

196
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,095
You can similarly complete the variance
for the binomial distribution to variance,

197
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:09,088
which is just the standard deviation
squared, would be n minus one times p

198
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:13,047
times one minus p.
And it's computed in a very similar

199
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:19,006
fashion so we, we won't have to do this in
any assignments or anything like that, but

200
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:24,036
in general you have the expected.
A value of X minus the mean squared, which

201
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:29,069
is the definition of variance, is just
this quantity summed over all possible

202
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:34,087
values of X times the probability of each
particular value that X can take.

203
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:41,046
The binomial distribution gets quite
impractical to compute, because the

204
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:46,061
binomial coefficient having those
factorials in there just can't be computed

205
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:50,057
for very large numbers.
So you typically use approximations.

206
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:55,025
So, in the limit of p being small, you can
use the Poisson distribution.

207
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:58,036
And then the limit of, the graph being
large.

208
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:01,066
So n is large, you can use the normal
distribution.

209
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:06,074
And the way that, that the poisson and
normal are going to look, for, for large

210
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:11,095
graphs is that it's going to be a nicely
symmetric distribution around the, the

211
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,025
mean value k.
Of course, if the probability is very,

212
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:19,094
very low, then the poisson distribution is
actually is, is not symmetric.

213
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:23,024
Right?
It might be, very much hitting up against

214
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:28,011
degree zero and then going from there.
But the main point to take away is that

215
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:33,842
we're not going to be seeing many nodes
that have say, a degree that's many times

216
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:39,027
higher than the average degree.
That's something you simply don't see, and

217
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:44,906
this is because this probability drops off
exponentially here as you get higher and

218
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:48,880
higher in degree.
So the basic insight that we get out of

219
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,683
this is that there are no hubs.
Hubs in the sense of some nodes that have

220
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:57,046
extremely high connectivity, extremely
high degree.

221
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:59,003
You just don't see this.
