1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,567
Next, we're going to talk about local
structure.

2
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:10,096
Local structure though is tied to this
small world phenomenon in this interesting

3
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:13,022
way.
Two people meet at a party.

4
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:18,962
Within a minute, they're going through,
you know, who they know and, sure enough,

5
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:22,280
they find that they know someone in
common.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,674
Now, what they are likely to conclude is
oh, what a small world?

7
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:34,200
This is a small world after all.
But what they're doing is they are closing

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,725
triads, that is they know, say, A and C
know B in common and now, A and C know

9
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,640
each other as well.
So,

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,940
This triadic closure is sometimes also
termed transitivity or clustering, and

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,811
what we want to know is how much of that
is going on in the network.

12
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:58,469
Because social networks, for example, are
highly clustered because a friend of a

13
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,282
friend is likely to also be a friend.
But in general, the networks do not need

14
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:10,449
to necessarily have this property and we
still want to know, to what extent is

15
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:14,876
clustering present.
So, one way to measure it is with the

16
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:20,648
global clustering coefficient which is
going to hit the number of closed

17
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:26,719
triangles against all connected triplets.
So, if you have a close triangle, it

18
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,003
actually generates three separate
connected triplets.

19
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:35,530
And hence, the factor of three in the
enumerator as well.

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,902
If the entire graph is a one connected
clique with all edges present, the

21
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:47,245
clustering coefficient is one and if there
are no triangles in the entire graph, then

22
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:53,215
this global clustering coefficient is zero
and we'll see in a little bit how to

23
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:57,582
evaluate values in between.
However, when clustering was first

24
00:01:57,582 --> 00:02:03,463
calculated by Watts and Strogatz in their
seminal paper which we'll be talking about

25
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:08,098
in the model section, they looked at a
local clustering coefficient.

26
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,425
That is a calculated clustering
coefficient where for each vertex and then

27
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,470
they averaged overall vertices in the
graph.

28
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,632
When you take the local clustering
coefficient, it's as if an individual

29
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:27,368
looks at all of their friends, and says,
out of all the possible friendships that

30
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:31,599
could exist between my friends, how many
are actually there?

31
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,976
And this will, the denominator here is
going to differ by whether this is a

32
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:42,691
directed network, in which case if you
have n friends, the number of potential

33
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:48,101
connections between them is n times n
minus one or if it's undirected, say,

34
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:53,325
triple link friendship is treated as
undirected, then the number of possible

35
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,738
pairings of your friends who could be who
could be friends with each other is n

36
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:06,080
times n minus one divided by two.
And as I mentioned, if you want to get the

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,788
clustering coefficient for the entire
graph, you just average over all the

38
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:15,337
nodes.
So, let's see how we would calculate for

39
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:19,219
one vertex i.
Here it is, and it has four neighbors or

40
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:23,105
four friends.
Three of the friends all know each other,

41
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:27,280
but the fourth friend, they're keeping
somehow hidden away.

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,326
They haven't introduced him or her to the
rest of their friends, and so all of those

43
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:39,589
edges are absent, that, that fourth friend
is not connected to any of the other three

44
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:42,396
friends.
So, to calculate the clustering

45
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:46,293
coefficient.
We looked at the number of neighbors, and

46
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:51,028
we know that the max number of connection
is n times n minus one divided by two, in

47
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:54,875
this case, six.
But only three of the connections are

48
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,352
present.
And so, the cluster coefficient is just

49
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:04,009
three over six or a half.
So, I'd like you to try this with this

50
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,755
vertex i which has three friends.
Can you calculate the clustering

51
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,837
coefficient?
Okay.

52
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:19,693
Hopefully, you calculated the cluster
coefficient as follows, you have three

53
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:24,172
neighbors which also means three potential
edges.

54
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:30,206
Cuz three times two divided by two is
three and two of these edges are actually

55
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:35,794
there giving you a clustering coefficient
of two-thirds.

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,844
Let's look at this from the perspective of
an individual tie.

57
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:48,880
What does it mean for that tie to be part
of one or more closed triads?

58
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,889
Typically, when a tie is part of sets
triads, it tends to also be a relationship

59
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:03,771
between individuals who would have some
sort of affinity and are likely in

60
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:08,767
frequent contact.
What you see actually is that if two

61
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:15,686
individuals are closed, so A and B are
closed and b, B and C are closed,

62
00:05:15,686 --> 00:05:21,588
You don't often see that A and C have no
tie at all, right?

63
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:27,490
So, there's something about closed ties
and closing triads.

64
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:34,058
And you can develop or you can just use
this measure of edge embeddedness which is

65
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:40,468
going to look at the number of nodes that
A and C share in common divided by the

66
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:44,030
total number of neighbors with either A or
B.

67
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,300
And the higher that quantity, the more
embedded the tie is.

68
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,128
The more, the more it's part of lots of
closed triads.

69
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:58,416
Now, you might say, well, you know, I
looked at my Facebook graph and some of

70
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:02,693
those ties seems pretty embedded but are
necessarily closed.

71
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:08,324
And I think again, it's really important
to think about what your network is or

72
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:14,026
such ties to be formed on Facebook, they
may just have been, you know, everyone at

73
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:18,303
the same high school adding each other on
Facebook, right?

74
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:23,863
So, it doesn't, it, it signifies a short
context but not necessarily a closeness.

75
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:28,477
On the other hand, if you were to filter
the ties, to only be individuals who

76
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:34,642
regularly interact on Facebook or
regularly interact in real life and he

77
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:40,940
still saw a lot of triads, you would you
could conclude that, you know, this is

78
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,400
really an embedded tied that's part of, of
closely knit clique.

79
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,099
Just another example of this.
So, there was an older study that asks

80
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:58,329
school children to name their first
through eighth choice of friends at the

81
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:02,530
school.
We know how this turns out right form the

82
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,675
dining table.
Data dining table, dining partners, dining

83
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:14,182
table partners data set but there is this
interesting analysis that was then done

84
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:19,893
that said, okay, let's go back to that
thought experiment, right before we had an

85
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:25,676
individual, and their 500 friends, and
their you know, and 500 of each of those

86
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:29,940
friends' friends, etc.
Here, they just looked at expansion by

87
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,722
two.
And in one case although this, this

88
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:39,061
graphic isn't going to match each of side
of the Arall and van Alstyne paper but

89
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:43,976
hopefully, illustrates the point.
So, when they use the, the seventh and

90
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:49,460
eighth choice, so these weren't their
closest friends, the number of people end

91
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,087
hubs out was far greater than when they
use the first and second choice and the

92
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:58,720
first and second choice looked something
like this.

93
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,429
It, my best friend's friend is also likely
to be my friend.

94
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:09,599
But if I look at my seventh or eighth
friend, and their seventh or eighth

95
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,010
choice, I'm likely to move pretty far
away.

96
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,290
So, there's this notion that, it's not
just,

97
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:24,504
You know, the, the distance, but that the
strength of the tie and the embeddedness

98
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,357
of the time matters as well.
And the question is, you know, is it good

99
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:32,926
to be embedded?
Well, perhaps, when you're in the middle

100
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:37,251
school or high school, being part of the
clique is a good thing.

101
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:42,812
It makes you feel secure, you have a gang
that you can hang with, you know, it's

102
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:46,399
good.
But as we saw in homework three, with the

103
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,337
Arall and van Alstyne paper, being a
broker has some advantages as well.

104
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:58,115
For example, the amount of novel
information that you receive, or looking

105
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:04,454
at Ron Byrd's papers, you're more likely
to be generating good ideas than to be

106
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:09,750
recognized for them, if you're a broker.
So, it really depends, right?

107
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,720
With, with all network analysis, it
depends.

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,704
Finally, there's a study that says, you
know, strong ties, weak ties let's not

109
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:25,064
treat them as binary, we just got this
awesome data set.

110
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:31,962
This is JP Onnela and his collaborators
well, just got this data set that has, you

111
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:38,701
know, a huge call graph who called whom
when so you can get a frequency of

112
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:47,403
interaction on this graph and they looked
at how things might diffuse, depending on

113
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:53,007
the strength of the time.
So, first of all, they found a skew in the

114
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:58,454
degree distribution, but they also found a
skew in the strength of the tie.

115
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:01,840
That is, how often two individuals
communicate.

116
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,361
Many individuals, you know, many pairs
communicate infrequently, and very few

117
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:12,802
communicate extremely frequently.
They also looked at the embeddedness of

118
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:16,567
the tie.
And I'll just to a seam run on this graph.

119
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:22,592
They found that, in general, there's a
positive relationship between how embedded

120
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:27,487
the tie is and how frequently the two
individuals communicate.

121
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,725
So, it's, it's just about a validation,
right?

122
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:36,825
Embedded ties tend to be closer ties at
least when you're talking about phone

123
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:40,274
communication.
Next, they wanted to know, well.

124
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:44,996
Anyway, so which, which is it?
Is it strong ties that are crucial for

125
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:49,719
information diffusion?
Because there's a peakly talk with often,

126
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:54,089
or is it weak ties, because they can go
further in the network.

127
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,798
It turned out it was neither, it was the
intermediate ties, the people you talk to

128
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,532
every so often, not so rarely but who
weren't part of your very local clique who

129
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:09,517
tended to be most instrumental for
information diffusion.

130
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:14,760
And they did another thing which was to
randomize the weights of the edges.

131
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,422
So, in the real world network, what you
have is that this strong ties that tend to

132
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:25,647
be embedded, but then, they just change
this, not change but they reassigned the

133
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:31,408
strengths of the tie at random to any edge
in the network and what they found,

134
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:38,644
So potentially now weak ties became strong
ties, etc., without changing the overall

135
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:45,057
configuration of who talks to whom.
And that caused information to move much

136
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:49,497
more rapidly.
So they did confirm that this kind of

137
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:55,993
localized clustered structure is impeding
network flow in a sense, you know, not,

138
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:59,940
no, no judgment about whether that's good
or bad.

139
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:09,006
You can do even better if you look at the
directionality of the links within a

140
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:15,107
closed triad or open triad, or even
slightly larger structures, because that

141
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:21,697
will capture more the dynamics of the
interactions that are actually you know,

142
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:27,229
kind of driving the network, or driving
the edges within the network.

143
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:30,890
So, you can take the network such as this
one.

144
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,582
And deconstruct it into different triads
and then, count, for example, how many

145
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:42,050
times did you see a feed forward loop.
Well, it looks like there's one here and

146
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,469
it looks like there is one here again.
So, what is that mean?

147
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:52,535
What type of a network is this, how did it
compare to other networks or to random

148
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:55,992
networks?
So, in addition to, you know, where, where

149
00:12:55,992 --> 00:13:02,315
do we have the, here's a feed forward
loop, you have a number of other three

150
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:06,699
node motifs.
You kind of enumerate all possible ones,

151
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:13,697
and so the feed forward loop occurs often
in neural networks, and it seems to be

152
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:20,357
used to neutralize biological noise
because x activates y, activates z, but x

153
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:25,758
also directly activates z.
You can you know, you can encounter other

154
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:29,185
things.
So, a single input module might be found

155
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:34,800
in gene control networks, where x might be
activating a number of other genes.

156
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,699
You can up it to four nodes, why stop at
three?

157
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:45,323
Well, I'm going to tell you next what
makes you want to do that but here is a

158
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:51,531
four node motif that has parallel tops and
this you might find in neural network and

159
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,329
in food webs.
And so, the lion who eats the zebra and

160
00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:00,880
the antelope, that's an antelope, who are
in turn, each munching some greenery.

161
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,259
And there are many more four node motifs
than there are three node ones, and it's

162
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,178
more computationally expensive to get
them, but it may be worth your while, if

163
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:19,251
you have not a huge network to deal with.
The reason why it's computationally

164
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:25,986
expensive is that not only do you want to
get the, the counts of how many times did

165
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:31,909
the feed forward loop occur, but, what you
would really like to know is, is that

166
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,480
unusual?
I mean, so, so it occurred five times.

167
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,399
Okay, is that high or is that low?
And the way that you can figure that out

168
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,390
is you generate the equivalent random
graphs.

169
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,709
Equivalent could mean that you just take
the number of nodes and you generate a

170
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:54,027
bunch of [UNKNOWN] random graphs or you
may think that some of the motifs are

171
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:59,647
result of the skew degree distribution.
In which case, you want to keep the degree

172
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:05,485
distribution the same, or you can do is
break the edges, so each node has the same

173
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:11,323
number of edge stubs, and then rewire them
at random, and see, even controlling for

174
00:15:11,323 --> 00:15:17,090
the degree distribution, is the number of
motifs that you counted, unusual or not.

175
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:23,072
And the way that you're specifically going
to do this, is you're going to calculate

176
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:27,508
the Z score.
So the, in your [UNKNOWN] random graph or

177
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:33,864
equivalent random graph, you're going to
get some counts and they are going to be

178
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:40,141
normally distributed for the number of
times that a certain motif occurs and

179
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:46,026
then, you're going to see where in this
distribution, your actual count lies.

180
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:51,938
If it's up here, it means that it, it's
overrepresented in your real network and

181
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:56,949
especially once you get Z scores above
two, this is what becomes the

182
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:02,178
statistically significant at the, you
know, alpha 0.05 level, meaning that

183
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:07,044
there's only five percent chance but it
occurred by tens that you saw such a

184
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:10,748
motif.
Similarly if you are all the way out here

185
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:16,703
with a very negative Z scores, it means
that somehow, this motif does not occur in

186
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:21,860
your network as much as it would if
everything was just wired randomly.

187
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,416
You can download software, free software,
that will run this analysis for you, and

188
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,989
it has this nice output, or you can
actually also use igraph.

189
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:39,435
It has, I think there it's called Triadics
Census but it's the, it's very much the

190
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:44,613
same functionality.
What this research group, [UNKNOWN]

191
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:52,976
research group, did next was to show that
a lot of different networks fall into

192
00:16:52,976 --> 00:17:00,490
these super families based on a motif
profile and they, they designed this kind

193
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,825
of measure that looked at the Z score for
each of the individual thirteen three node

194
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:13,993
motifs and then it just looked at, you
know, whether the Z score follows one

195
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:20,828
pattern or whether it follows another and,
for example, language networks that have

196
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:24,996
edges between words that occur adjacently
in text.

197
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:30,435
So, to be or not to be that's a little
four cycle in there.

198
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:36,400
Across different languages, the motif
profile is very similar.

199
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,787
So, your task is to find, you know, based
on their triad census profiles, which two

200
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:46,300
kinds of networks exhibit similar
structure?

201
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:55,136
Hopefully what you found, they actually
are plotted together is that, the world

202
00:17:55,136 --> 00:18:02,576
wide web and social networks tend to have
similar frequencies of different motifs,

203
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:09,794
not to say that all web social but perhaps
some of the dynamic driving social

204
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:15,122
networks, for example, triadic closure,
friends introducing one another may also

205
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:20,955
be at work in the web where if one page
who likes another and might start copying

206
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:27,231
some of its links again closing triads.
So, to understand this further, can you

207
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:32,980
tell which of the following triads is
underrepresented in social networks?

208
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:40,578
Hopefully, you've seen that it's this one,
triad number six, and this, if you

209
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:47,023
remember from the beginning of the
presentation, is the forbidden triad.

210
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:53,212
That is A and B have a mutual tie, and B
and C have a mutual tie, but somehow, A

211
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:58,988
and C don't have a tie to each other.
And you might imagine that poor B is,

212
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:05,231
really stressed out, because B gets a long
with A, and B gets along with C, but

213
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:09,680
somehow A and C do not get along with each
other in turn.

214
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,463
So, just a recap on motifs and clustering.
So, given a particular structure, you can

215
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:20,955
search in network.
For example, you can count the complete

216
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:27,024
triad so you can summarize that as a
cluster coefficient or you can, you know,

217
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:32,146
create this motif profile.
The advantage is that these motifs can

218
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:38,482
represent certain functions or certain
trends and, and just, you can validate by

219
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:43,187
seeing whether those are present in a
network, or you can discover them.

220
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:46,965
You know, hey, this motif is very frequent
in this network.

221
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:50,014
Let me figure out, you know, what is
causing it.

222
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:54,322
And I can't understand some of the
underlying dynamics, which is a real

223
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:56,510
boost.
So, for example, if you have,

224
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:03,233
What you think is a good model of how your
network is being generated, and then you

225
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:09,228
run the motif profile on your model
simulated data, and you run it on your

226
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:15,546
actual network, and they don't agree, it
means that something's missing in your

227
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:19,192
model.
And the motif profile is very rich, and

228
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:25,430
can, discerning these differences.
One disadvantage of using motifs is that

229
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:30,959
again, it's, it's just like with the cake
cliques and cliques and some cake course,

230
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:36,283
you can look for these motifs, but you may
not be able to tell whether they're

231
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:40,311
actually part of some sort of larger
interesting structure.

232
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:45,362
So, because you're looking with a
microscope, you may actually miss the big
