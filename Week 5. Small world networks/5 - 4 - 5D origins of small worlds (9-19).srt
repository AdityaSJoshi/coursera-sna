1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,725
In this final portion, we'll see where the
small world structure might arise from.

2
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:09,542
Now, you can, of course, just assign
properties to nodes.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,652
Such a spatial location or group
membership.

4
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:18,024
And then, add edges accordingly.
So you can have many edges between people

5
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:23,255
who are in the same small group.
But people who are tied only very loosely

6
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:27,638
through a large group are much less likely
to, have an edge.

7
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:33,293
However, it would be even neater if we
knew you know, something underneath that's

8
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:36,965
a driving.
That edge formation that doesn't dictate

9
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:42,182
okay if you're in this size.
Group, your probability of linking is x.

10
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:49,549
Can we sort of derive Small World networks
from some sort of basic criteria that we

11
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:56,343
would like to optimize in the network.
So, I'm going to show you two very related

12
00:00:56,343 --> 00:01:02,307
geographical models where we're going to
place nodes on 2-d surface.

13
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:09,148
So they're going to have a location.
But we're going to determine who is going

14
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:15,988
to link to whom based on various criteria.
So one such function we may want to

15
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:21,952
optimize is, you know you can determine
energy or anything like that.

16
00:01:21,952 --> 00:01:28,154
We're going to have a penalty essentially
for The average shortest path.

17
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,182
So we want nodes to be a few hops away
from each other.

18
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:35,771
So we want to minimize the average
shortest path.

19
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:40,024
And at the same time.
They also want to minimize the length of

20
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:43,334
the edges, the actual physical length of
the edges.

21
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:48,696
You can imagine that, you have spools of
wire and the wire is copper and it costs

22
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:52,536
something, right.
So, you want to not have wire all over the

23
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:57,898
place, you want to do things efficiently.
And, so, the average shortest path is just

24
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:03,327
going to look at all the distances between
I and j, but in a graph sense, the graph

25
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:06,505
distance.
And, then this other wiring distance is

26
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:12,354
actually going to look at the coordinates
and see how, How much wire did you expend

27
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:16,454
wiring these together.
So here's your quiz question,

28
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:23,086
Given that this function incorporates two
things, a person's preference for short

29
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:27,590
distances, and a small number of hops,
let's think about.

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,855
Two different networks.
One is a road network where you're

31
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:37,959
driving, and another is an airplane or
actually air transit network where you're

32
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,181
taking a plane from city to city.
So from the passenger's point of view,

33
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:49,386
what would you like to optimize in an air.
Transit network as opposed to a road

34
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:54,143
network.
Okay, so hopefully for the air transit

35
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:57,684
network, you want to minimize the number
of hops.

36
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:02,848
Because, landing, and then you know,
switching planes, is a very risky

37
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,389
business.
Right, 'cuz your plane might be late, you

38
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:12,771
might miss your connections, etcetera.
Versus covering long distances physically

39
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:19,798
is relatively easy in a plane so you might
go from Sanfrancisco to Atlanta only to

40
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:26,089
end up in Detroit and that's not so bad
but if you're making such a big detour

41
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:32,870
driving you, you'd be pretty unhappy if
the road network looked like the airline

42
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:40,934
transportation network.
So let's look at what these networks How

43
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:44,846
they're structured if you optimize.
And the method here,

44
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:50,679
And I'll provide hopefully a net logo app
that you can use to simulate this

45
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:53,951
yourself.
But, what, what it's called, simulating

46
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,085
annealing.
Simulated annealing.

47
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:01,135
So first, you raise up the temperature
meaning you're willing to accept

48
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:06,967
configurations that are high energy.
That is maybe you have high wiring cost or

49
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:12,231
lots of hops, or something like that.
And then you tune the energy down and,

50
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,650
actually the temperature down.
And.

51
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:21,450
And you get into lower and lower energy
configurations until you hopefully find

52
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,009
some sort of optimum.
So here we have The, the cost of the wire

53
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:34,177
becoming cheaper and cheaper, and you can
see as this happens, you get more and more

54
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:41,431
edges that cover more and more distance
until finally you get, you know, kind of a

55
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:48,442
hub configuration where every other node
is connected to one node, meaning that it

56
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:51,142
has, you know, a, a very short number of
hops.

57
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,031
Right?
If, if they're all connected to the same

58
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:57,800
node, and most it's two hops to anywhere
else in the network.

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,548
But, you've just exp-, spent a lot of
wire, or you may get configurations with,

60
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,876
actually multiple, hubs as well.
So I'll let you play with that for the

61
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:13,363
assignment and see if you can, get this
nice, hub structure.

62
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:16,588
And another cute way of looking at this is
to.

63
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:20,094
You don't want to do this while you're
optimizing.

64
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:23,739
Because, of course, then it's going to
mess things up.

65
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:28,857
Because your nodes now have moved.
And so the distance between them is no

66
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:34,032
longer accurate.
But you can start out with the original

67
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:40,267
lattice laid out.
And then, kind of let it, let the springs

68
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:45,894
do their job.
And so this one has a few short range

69
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:50,869
short cuts and you can see the network
kind of coming in.

70
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:57,501
And then here is that network with the big
hub and several, and several hubs.

71
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,254
And here I guess it's several hubs as
well.

72
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:08,149
So you can actually see the network kind
of contracting due to these rewirings.

73
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:13,560
It's making it from a large world to a
relatively small world.

74
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:17,990
Here is a second model with a similar
idea.

75
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,385
That, again, you have some penalty for the
actual Euclidean distance that you have to

76
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,083
traverse.
And then also the number of hops.

77
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:35,510
And here, instead of starting with all the
links from, in the beginning.

78
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,850
You are going to, just apply this rule
that you're going to add edges.

79
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:48,290
And you're going, one by one, and you're
going to add the one with the smallest

80
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,739
weight, that is this distance.
So for example if you're laying rail

81
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:58,527
tracks, so you know, how much track do you
have to put down.

82
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:02,408
And then what is the distance to the root
note?

83
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:09,343
So depending on this parameter beta, then
you're going to get different, different

84
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:14,375
types of networks.
And, in fact, when you put a high price on

85
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:21,034
the Euclidean distance, you get something
that looks more like a road network.

86
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:28,212
When, distance is cheap, you get something
that looks more like those air transit,

87
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:33,920
networks that are nicely plotted in your,
in-flight magazine.

88
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,438
Quiz question, a network that contains
many hubs with far reaching edges is

89
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:48,958
indicative of which of these following
criteria that lead to the network being

90
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,347
formed?
Okay.

91
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:56,158
So to recap, the world is small if you
look at it as a network.

92
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,823
Yet it has lots of interesting local
structure, which we can capture with

93
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,857
clustering.
Also we can do a deep dive, look at motif

94
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:09,582
analysis.
Watts and Strogats came up with a nice

95
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:13,850
simple small world model.
Other models though, including.

96
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,488
One created by Watts,
Look at other structures geographical

97
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:26,601
models, and hierarchical models that say
that it's not just random rewiring, the

98
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:32,847
probability of an edge existing depends on
the physical distance or the

99
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:39,979
organizational distance between two nodes.
And finally, the way that we get to this

100
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,179
structure may be a result of some sort of
optimization process.

101
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,578
These networks are going to be used, may
be they are chanced networks, may be they

102
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:54,311
are a result of how individuals have to
communicate within the company.

103
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:59,577
And, so that makes actually the structure
extra interesting, because it tells us

104
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:03,310
about the underlying needs and the
underlying processes.

105
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:10,546
Next week, what we're going to be doing is
learning about how learning and diffusion

106
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:16,490
are affected by small-world and other
network topologies.

107
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,300
So, I'll see you then.
