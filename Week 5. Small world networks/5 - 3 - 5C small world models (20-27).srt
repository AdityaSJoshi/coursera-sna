1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,594
Okay.
So, so far, we have established two

2
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:06,809
things.
There is a small world phenomenon in

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:12,644
social and other networks, and there's all
this interesting local structure, which we

4
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,700
can capture in part by measuring
clustering.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,256
And this extends beyond social networks,
right? That you have high clustering and

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:25,701
short outer shores paths.
For example, in, you have this in neural

7
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:31,118
networks, after collaboration networks,
which are admittedly social semantic

8
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,800
networks of languages, and networks such
as food webs.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,867
The first two tie it together.
How is it possible to have high clustering

10
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:45,121
and low average shortest path where Watts
and Strogatz.

11
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,221
What they said is let's start with a
regular lattice.

12
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:55,410
In this lattice, every node is connected
to it's two closest neighbors on either

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,748
side, so four neighbors total.
And you can, you can vary this number of

14
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:04,458
course.
And, we're going to start rewiring, or

15
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:09,166
just adding random edges.
Eventually, it's going to look like

16
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:14,664
Erdos-Renyi Random Graph because all of
the edges are going to be random.

17
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:18,990
But, what they wanted to know is what
happens in the middle.

18
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,096
And, so I mentioned two ways that they can
go about this.

19
00:01:23,096 --> 00:01:28,228
They can rewire the links.
So, for example here, this node used to be

20
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:34,020
connected to this one in the lattice, but
now it has a random tie to a randomly

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,734
chosen other node, or.
You can simply just add edges on top of

22
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:45,003
the existing lattice, eventually getting
something that looks mostly random, but

23
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:48,970
it's overlaid on the original lattice, in
the ring.

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,541
And you just take care not to do some
things.

25
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:58,493
For example, rewire to yourself, or, you
know, have multiple edges to the same

26
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,917
node.
So, just a recap, you have this lattice,

27
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:08,610
each node has four nearest neighbors and
we want to distinguish node that we can

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:15,143
tune what is the network look like when
there's a small probability of linking to

29
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:21,517
a random node as opposed to just your
neighbors on the lattice and what happens.

30
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:26,457
So, for small p, you know, it should look
like a regular lattice.

31
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:30,840
For large p, we know it should look like a
random graph.

32
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,973
So, just to check your understanding,
which one of these is a result of higher

33
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:41,550
rewiring probability.
So, hopefully, you can see that this one

34
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,500
has had the more rewiring happening or
actually, it looks like that in, in this

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,780
algorithm, the edges were just added on
top.

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,300
But now, we're interested to what happens
in between?

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,238
As we vary p, is it true that you can't
have small shortest paths without also

38
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:07,553
having low clustering or can you find a
sweet spot?

39
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:10,140
And indeed, if you vary.
P here.

40
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,431
So, this is one percent of the links
rewired.

41
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:20,197
Here, you have ten% of the links.
You can see that even by the time you have

42
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:26,506
one percent rewired, the average shortest
path of the network has pretty much

43
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:31,900
dropped to far below what it was in the
regular lattice.

44
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,758
On the other hand, the clustering
coefficient is still a pretty much at the

45
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:42,050
value that it was in the lattice.
So,

46
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:48,221
You got this in between regime where,
where just a few random links you have

47
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,956
high clustering but low average shortest
path.

48
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:58,533
And then, of course, as you continue to
add more and more random links, then the

49
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:05,273
clustering itself, falls and will, and the
average shortest path will continue to be

50
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:09,495
very low.
It's basically asymptote to what it is for

51
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:13,150
the random graph.
And you can try this out in.

52
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,190
Net logo.
So, you can set this up.

53
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:23,603
And then, you can vary the probability
like so and observe what happens to the

54
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:28,640
clustering coefficient and the average
shortest path.

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,554
You can estimate how the clustering
coefficient falls as a function of the

56
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:39,760
rewiring probability p, simply by
considering that the chance that.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,780
A rewiring will form a triad by accident
is very slow.

58
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,439
What's, what's going to contribute more to
the clustering coefficient is the

59
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,470
probability that out of this triad, all
three of these edges were preserved which

60
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,351
means that.
You know, each one of them is going to be

61
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:05,398
rewired with probability one rise to p.
So, the probability that all three of them

62
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:11,297
are intact is one minus p to the third.
And then, the clustering coefficient for

63
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:17,270
this given rewired probability is, then,
is just a drop from the original lattice.

64
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,266
Clustering coefficient times one minus p
to the third.

65
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:26,595
And this is what the function looks like.
Here, it's on linear instead of

66
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:31,479
logarithmic access, axis.
But there isn't really such an analytical

67
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:39,563
derivation for average shortest path.
And here, we can just look at a bunch of

68
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:45,490
different networks and see how their
empirical properties not chopped with what

69
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,121
we expect of a small world network.
So, the, the thing to look at is these are

70
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:57,048
networks that are widely varying in sizes,
there are quite different film actors,

71
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:03,420
co-authors of network substrate graph and
E.coli and the CL against neural network.

72
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:11,127
This is the actual shortest path and this
is the shortest path and the equivalent

73
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:17,727
random graph and you can see here that
these values are actually quite, quite

74
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:21,239
close, if not, in some cases, even a bit
lower.

75
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,865
So, it's not the case that because these
networks have more structure that their

76
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:33,772
average shortest path is any is
significantly longer than it is for an

77
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:39,360
equivalent Erdos-Renyi Random Graph.
And then, if we look at clustering,

78
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,401
Here is what it would be for the
equivalent random graph.

79
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:48,789
You can see rather small values and the
actual observed is much, much higher.

80
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:54,320
So, these are all highly clustered network
that have this small world property.

81
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,937
So, which of the following is a
description matching a small world network

82
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:06,293
just to make sure we, we understand what
we're talking about here over and over

83
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:10,311
again.
What is missing though from the

84
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:14,609
Watts-Strogatz model?
It's, it's neat that it could explain

85
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:20,685
clustering coexisting with short paths but
there's much in the real world that it

86
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,760
doesn't capture.
For example.

87
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,305
It rewires the links at random and for
most of us, our experience is that we're

88
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:34,061
not just as likely to know someone across
the globe, no matter what Chris there is

89
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:40,097
doing at the moment to help us bring us
altogether then someone who maybe is in

90
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:44,660
the neighboring town, right?
So, maybe it would makes sense for the

91
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,275
links to depend on geography, yes I'm mush
more like to know people living on my

92
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:55,400
street but I'm also more likely to know
people who live in the same city.

93
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,713
Than I mam to know people in the distance.
And what about hierarchical structure and

94
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:06,342
groups?
I mean, you can think of geography in a

95
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:13,206
hierarchical way here a neighborhood is
part of the city that might be part of a

96
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:16,820
larger urban area that's part of.
A county, etc.

97
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:22,261
So how is that captured?
And maybe geography is not the only the

98
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:27,858
only kind of nested structure that we're
in and we're part of different

99
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,201
organizations as well.
How are those nested?

100
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:37,264
And then, it doesn't capture the presence
of hubs which we know to play a very

101
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:42,550
important role in many networks with the
Watts-Strogatz model.

102
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:47,918
For the, for the original lattice, each
node has exactly the same degree.

103
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:53,431
So, naturally, there are no hubs but even
as you rewire the model that you're

104
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:58,872
tending to is that Erdos-Renyi random
graph which again, does not have hubs.

105
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:04,893
So, the model doesn't really capture a lot
of the real structure but it goes a long

106
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:11,999
way towards explaining what we do see.
Here is a hint as to how geographic ties

107
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:16,082
may be distributed.
This is from the original paper by

108
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:19,636
Milgram.
He says, the geographic movement of the

109
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:23,492
message from Nebraska to Massachusetts is
striking.

110
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:29,616
There's a progressive closing in on the
target areas, each new person is added to

111
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:33,548
the chain.
So, it seems like the way that the message

112
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:37,404
is traveling is that it makes large hops
initially.

113
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:41,790
And then, as it gets closer, it's really
homing in using.

114
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,680
Short nearby ties.
So, how is that possible?

115
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,690
Well, John Kleinberg proposed a model of
small worlds that they are laid out on the

116
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,602
lattice so, for example, on the 2D
lattice, he said, in addition to these

117
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:06,358
local lattice edges, you're going to have
the probability of a link between same

118
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:13,284
nodes, u and b, to be proportional to the
distance between u and b to this exponent

119
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:17,565
minus r.
And the question is, what happens as this

120
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:22,489
exponent varies.
So, I'm going to just show you briefly a

121
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:28,820
net logo download that I'm going to try
and figure into your assignment.

122
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,432
So here, we can vary what r is and.
You can set up the network, it's, it's

123
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:42,088
rather slow because you need a large
lattice in order to see how the search

124
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:48,660
starts to work and then, we're going to
repeatedly be selecting a target and a

125
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,400
starting point and seeing using a gritty
search at each point, each node selects.

126
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,768
One of it's neighbors who's closest to the
target, how quickly does the message reach

127
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:09,264
the target and you can also bury the.
This probability so we can make the links

128
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:16,023
highly localized by increasing r.
So, let's just look at what that looks

129
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:19,556
like.
Hopefully we'll, you should, you should,

130
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:26,152
you should be able to see the edges, okay,
right, so and all the edges are local and

131
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:32,668
if they do come out, they're just kind of
being very, very short bridges and so if

132
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:36,226
we.
Then do a search, you can see it going

133
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:42,945
very, very gradually because it basically
has to make all these little stuffs.

134
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:50,450
On the other hand, if we change it so that
we allow many long range times, let's see

135
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,861
what that looks like.
The, the edges might be so far rate to be

136
00:11:55,861 --> 00:12:01,620
being that though obscure the lattice
structure altogether indeed.

137
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,543
And now, we can.
Start and here, the lattice really isn't

138
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:16,233
large enough to, to, to show what's going
on but typically, you see a very large

139
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:21,920
initial job and then kind of going along
the lattice.

140
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:30,790
And what's that showing you is that maybe
it's bested by back to the slides, okay.

141
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:39,371
So, what you should be seeing is when the
edges are random, you have these long hops

142
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:47,021
initially but then, there are no short
range ties, you basically have to go

143
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:53,750
right, to get to the target.
And, you know, there are many other edges

144
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,380
present but none of them really took you
in the right direction.

145
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:08,291
Oh, sorry, I guess I'm still running Net
Logo because it's been very loud.

146
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:16,049
[laugh] Okay, so, hopefully, it's going to
quite down On the other hand, if we have

147
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:21,264
this very high value of r, then what
happens is that we just don't have that

148
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:25,243
many long ranged ties.
So, again, what kind of ties, you know,

149
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:30,527
there, there are ties that are heading in
the right direction but we're still stuck

150
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:35,876
making very slow progress.
And then, finally, ideally, for one over

151
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:42,544
distance squared, what we have is both the
presence of some long range ties and then,

152
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:48,260
some shorter range ties once we're close
to the target that we can use.

153
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,325
And this is this concept of navigability
that is thus, the placement of the edges

154
00:13:57,325 --> 00:14:03,537
allow you to, at each step.
Makes some amount of progress towards your

155
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:10,110
goal and what Kleinberg proved was that
indeed, if the exponent bar is two, that

156
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:16,933
is the probability of linking to someone
falls one over the distance squared, then

157
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:23,589
you can make enough progress on, at each
step such that the number of steps that

158
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,500
you have to take only draws
logarithmically.

159
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,211
So, your quiz question, just to test
whether you understood this, what is true

160
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:41,440
about the network or the probability of a
tie balls off as distance to the -two.

161
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,947
And just to remind you, I mean, I've
brought this up before that the

162
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:56,840
interesting structure that we see in
social networks, in other networks could

163
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,317
really be a projection of a bio part type
network.

164
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:08,121
For example, if you have different context
and individuals and then, you have

165
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:13,045
individuals who share a context have
joined ties.

166
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:17,800
So, why not model this explicitly?
So.

167
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:25,210
Kleinberg also proposed a hierarchical
network model where you have these nested

168
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:32,345
groups and the probability that two
individuals share an edge is proportional

169
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:40,122
to a constant to the minus alpha and then,
the distance that you have to go up in the

170
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:47,104
hierarchy to get from one to the other.
Also, if you just or have these nested

171
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:54,294
groups and then, you have q being decided
the smallest group that these nodes of

172
00:15:54,294 --> 00:16:01,304
interest b and w belong to, then, the
probability of an edge existing between b

173
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:08,763
and w is going to be q to the minus alpha.
So, two different ways of representing

174
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:13,891
nested group structure.
Such that you can now not only use it to

175
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:19,266
represent geography, as I said,
neighborhood parts of the cities, parts of

176
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:25,612
the counties but also other things such as
individuals who are taking the same class

177
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:31,585
at a university, who are, who have the
same major or in the same school within

178
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:36,886
the university, who are part of the same
university, who are part of the

179
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:43,816
universities in that country, etc.
And at, concurrently, Watts, Dodds and,

180
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:50,677
and Newman proposed another hierarchical
moment which is very similar that said

181
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:56,877
that the probability that i and j know
each other is again, proportional to

182
00:16:56,877 --> 00:17:03,160
either the minus alpha x squared, x is
equivalent to h in the previous slide.

183
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:10,187
It's the, it's the number of steps up in
the hierarchy have to go in order to join

184
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:14,385
two individuals.
And what was different about their work

185
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:20,279
was that they looked at navigation when
you have different, different hierarchy.

186
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:26,245
So, you can concurrently have hierarchy
for geography, a hierarchy for occupation

187
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:31,205
and when individuals are searching, they
can switch between hierarchy.

188
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:36,956
So, if I know that my target lives in
Massachusetts but I also know that he is a

189
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:42,778
sock broker, well then, I can decide oh, I
knew someone who is not in Massachusetts

190
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:47,592
but is a stock broker or I can choose,
Oh, I know someone who lives in the

191
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:52,770
neighboring town even through they are not
in the banking industry I, I will forward

192
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:58,260
the message for them.
And these.

193
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,512
These theoretical models then correspond
closely to what was found in early

194
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:08,902
experiments, there's a need to reverse
small world experiment that [inaudible]

195
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:14,292
that there are the same ones who looked at
the accuracy of the chains that

196
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:19,544
individuals are able to create.
So, they gave the individuals a whole slew

197
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:23,690
of hypothetical target.
So, they weren't actually running the

198
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,629
chains, they were just curious who would
you pick and why.

199
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:32,260
And they found that overwhelmingly, people
chose based on geography.

200
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,026
The in-occupation.
So, those two hierarchies make a lot of

201
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:41,313
sense and only seven% were chosen because
they we're hops, because that's someone

202
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:46,072
who knows a lot of other people.
And also, there was an absence of second

203
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:50,189
degree strategies so.
I'm going to pick my friend because I know

204
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:54,760
they know someone in Massachusetts.
So, that seems to be relatively aware.

205
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,337
If we go back to the e-mail experiment
that was front out of Columbia one

206
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:08,799
additional nice analysis that they did was
to look at successful chains versus ones

207
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,953
that didn't quite make it.
And what they found with this successful

208
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:20,106
chain was that they disproportionately
used weak ties, professional ties, ties

209
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:25,876
originating at work or collage or those
that focus on, on the target's work.

210
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:32,876
And they disproportionately avoided using
hops and there was no evidence of funnels.

211
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:39,317
So, in the original Milgram experiment.
It seemed like the last people in the

212
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:44,650
chain tended to be the same.
To, you know, another stock broker and

213
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,156
maybe a tailor from the from the town
where the stock broker lived.

214
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:55,190
But there was no evidence of fondling in
this new experiment.

215
00:19:55,388 --> 00:20:01,022
And also people in successful teams used
family and friendship ties less and this

216
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:06,456
tend to, tend to be getting strong ties.
And the strategy interestingly parallel to

217
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:11,891
that of the Milgram experiment which is
that individuals first focus on geography

218
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:16,994
you know like get it to the right country
then worry about what the, what the

219
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:22,627
person's profession is but to those the
last few hops tended to reach the targets

220
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:27,598
professionally as supposed to just trying
to narrow down geographically.
