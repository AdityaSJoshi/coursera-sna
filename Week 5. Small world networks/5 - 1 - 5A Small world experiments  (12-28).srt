1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,507
Here we are in week five of Social Network
Analysis.

2
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:07,555
This week we're going to be looking at
small world networks.

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:12,816
The concepts this week are going to be
combining what we learned about random

4
00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:16,526
graphs, in particular, error differing you
random graphs.

5
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:21,254
What we found interesting about those is
that those can really grow.

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:27,308
You can get networks of millions of nodes
and yet, the average shortest path, which

7
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:33,510
scales just as the logarithm of the number
of nodes will then be, you know, something

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,350
on the order of ten and that seems quite
remarkable.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,058
Then we looked at some real world networks
and discovered that they had interesting

10
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:50,448
community structure that is on somewhat
more, on a somewhat more localized scale,

11
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:56,038
their, the structure is not random.
But we haven't yet really delved into the

12
00:00:56,038 --> 00:01:00,830
very local structure.
No, the structure of the network around

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,782
the particular node.
So what we're going to be doing this week

14
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:09,931
is filling the gap.
You know, is it possible for real world

15
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:15,329
networks to have small world properties,
like random networks do and at the same

16
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,660
time, can we recognized the interesting
structure they have at the local, you

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,985
know, at the local level.
So just to outline, I'm going to start

18
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:30,325
with Milgram's famous small world
experiment which established that it's a

19
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:33,530
small world, when you look at social
networks.

20
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,439
Then I'm going to be looking at some local
structure and metrics, starting with the

21
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,498
clustering co-efficient and then delving
into motif analysis.

22
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:50,841
I'm going to then present some models, the
very famous small world model by Watts &

23
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:57,483
Strogatz, that reconciles networks having
clustering and at the same time having

24
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:02,216
short path lengths.
And then, we're going to look at a few

25
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:08,859
other small world, models, having to do
with geography or having to do with

26
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:13,629
hierarchical groups.
And finally, we are going to look at, you

27
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:19,616
know, now just take these small world
networks for granted, but say, where does

28
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:24,281
the structure arise from?
You know, what, why do we get small world

29
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:28,013
networks?
And then, next week, we'll be looking at

30
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:33,222
some of the consequences.
What does small world structure meant for

31
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,954
diffusion, for learning and for
coordination?

32
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:41,655
So, you know, that's still to come.
Okay. On to Milgram.

33
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:48,930
Stanley Milgram is a Harvard sociologist
who wanted to know how many hops is it

34
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,305
between any two individuals and the United
States.

35
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,735
So he recruited,
I think he put some,

36
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:59,055
An add in the newspaper.
Individuals in Nebraska and actually in,

37
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:04,050
in Massachusetts as well, but the
Nebraskans are the more interesting sudd

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,056
and he gave them a task.
He said here's this stockbroker in

39
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:12,139
Massachusetts.
I want you to mail this pamphlet to him,

40
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:17,355
But you can't do it directly, you can't
just you know, stick it in the, in the

41
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:20,983
mail.
You're supposed to mail it to someone that

42
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:24,385
you know, whom you know on a first name
basis.

43
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:30,130
And they're going to mail it to someone
who they know on a first name basis.

44
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,440
And we're going to see how many steps it's
going to take.

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,755
Back then, when he asked people, how many
steps they thought it would take, most of

46
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:43,955
them guessed hundreds,
Because they were thinking of their local

47
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:47,827
network and most of the people they knew
were rather local.

48
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,946
And so, Masschusetts seemed awfully far
way and they just imagined that it will

49
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:57,474
take lots and lots of steps.
That turn out to not to be the case at The

50
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:02,396
average number of steps was 6.5 and this
how the expression Six degrees of

51
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:09,369
separation was coined.
This experiment was repeated in 2003 with

52
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:16,320
e-mail and the task was very similar but
you had eighteen targets instead of one

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,359
target, thirteen different countries and
you had far larger initial participation.

54
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:27,964
So they got 60,000 participants into the
experiments.

55
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:35,263
24,000 message chains, but only fewer than
400 actually made it to the target versus

56
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:39,000
Milgram had about a, you know, a
twenty percent completion rate.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,427
And here, the average risk path which span
the globe was really short; it was just

58
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:50,104
four steps.
So, let's think about whether six or, or

59
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:53,503
four.
We'll see how four is not the right,

60
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:59,555
number really, how you can correct for it,
Whether that's surprising?

61
00:04:59,555 --> 00:05:05,606
So, in order to figure that out, first we
need to know on average how many

62
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:09,586
individuals does some one have in their
network.

63
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:16,062
Pool and Kochen in 1978, they did a study
and estimated that the number's around 500

64
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:21,354
to 1500 acquaintances.
So let's be conservative, and let's say

65
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,519
it's 500.
And let's also imagine that we're in a

66
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:31,506
random network and so your friends'
friends are just randomly chosen.

67
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:36,191
So they're very unlikely to overlap with
your friends.

68
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:43,045
Now, if everyone has 500 friends, the
average person would have how many friends

69
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:45,764
of friends?
Okay.

70
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:52,357
So, if you have 500 friends and each of
them has 500 friends in turn.

71
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:56,623
You would expect 250,000 friends of
friends.

72
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:01,567
Pretty neat, right?
As long as the network is random.

73
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:06,900
Now, let's extend this to friends of
friends of friends.

74
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,974
Okay. In this case we have 500 to the
third power and that, it means that, you

75
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:23,732
know, once you're three hops out, you have
125,000,000 friends of friends of friends

76
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:30,249
and that starts to resemble a significant
portion of the U.S.

77
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:35,647
Population.
So, the conclusion is that if networks are

78
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:39,100
random,
Then six is not a surprising number at

79
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,193
all.
In fact [laugh], maybe it's a little bit

80
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:47,126
on the, on the large side.
What if, on the, the other hand, networks

81
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:52,664
were completely cliquish, right?
So, all of my friend's friends are my

82
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:57,063
friends as well.
They're not allowed to have any other

83
00:06:57,063 --> 00:07:02,520
friends outside of my friends.
Well, in that case, what would be true?

84
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,817
So, in that case, you actually can't reach
any other part of the network, because,

85
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:16,059
the, you're in a complete clique and no
one is allowed to have any edges outside

86
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:20,194
of that clique.
So, your distance one, to anyone within

87
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:26,045
the clique, but you can't reach, its like
infinite distance to anywhere else.

88
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:31,584
So now the question is,
The small world phenomenon, how does it

89
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:36,576
arise, right?
It seems very natural in a random graph,

90
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:43,488
but in an entirely cliquish graph, we're
not sure, oh, oh, whether it can arise.

91
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:51,072
But first, let's talk about the accuracy
of the number six or four, depending on

92
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:58,444
which experiment you're talking about.
One reason why this isn't necessarily an

93
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:02,900
accurate number is that not all the chains
are completed.

94
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,075
And the question is, are shorter chains
more likely to be completed than longer

95
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,359
ones?
And one consideration is, what is the

96
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,658
attrition rate?
And also, is that attrition rate uniform,

97
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:22,833
with respect to, you know, whether that
person is the next one in the chain from

98
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,599
the starting person.
They might approach it with greater

99
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,364
enthusiasm because they were recruited.
So the initial person was recruited.

100
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:35,091
They might be interested.
They might tell, you know, they might

101
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:39,795
write the next person and say, this is
such a cool experiment, you know, try it

102
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:43,705
out, but then that person may be passing
on with less enthusiasm.

103
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:48,837
Similarly, maybe the people further down
in the chain are actually getting closer

104
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:52,677
to target so maybe they are less likely to
drop the message,

105
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:59,029
Because you know, the goal might be near.
However, neither of those turns out to be

106
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,130
true.
You have pretty stable attrition, no

107
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,760
matter, you know, which step in the chain
you are.

108
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,802
So now, we can start to calculate the
probability that a message gets through

109
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:18,168
given a constant attrition rate.
So let's say it's, it's a half probability

110
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:23,533
that someone's going to pass the message
versus just not do anything with it.

111
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:28,667
And so, if you have a chain of legnth two,
so one, two, You have only this, this

112
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:33,461
person's in question, right, this, the
initial center sends for sure, otherwise

113
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:38,508
there's no chain and we don't count it.
And the recipient receives it so they

114
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:43,491
don't have to take any further action.
So here we're just wondering, you know, is

115
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:48,159
this person going to pass it on.
So let's calculate the probability that a

116
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,819
chain of length two gets through and then
a chain of length five.

117
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,913
So, you should see that a chain of length
two is much more likely to pass through

118
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:05,153
than a chain of length five.
And so, you can then go back and try and

119
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:08,679
infer what the true distance distribution
is.

120
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:15,103
So for example, for the email experiment,
their average number of hops was four, But

121
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:21,057
once they corrected and said well the
longer chains were less likely to get

122
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:24,739
through,
They had an estimate of a median chain

123
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:30,928
length somewhere between five and seven,
sort of recovering that six degrees of

124
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:36,416
separation again.
A second factor in how accurate that

125
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,902
number is, is that individuals actually
may not be finding the shortest paths,

126
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,895
right?
[laugh] So, they don't know what the

127
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:50,096
global structure of the network.
All they're doing is, they're passing the

128
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:54,870
message on to someone they think is more
likely to know the target.

129
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:01,209
And there was this nice study in 2005 that
mapped out completely a network within an

130
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,162
organization,
So they, they had that map and then they

131
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:08,966
had those individuals.
So the was who talks to whom,

132
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:12,547
Right?
And then, they ran Milgram's] experiment,

133
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:18,513
which said, you know, past this to someone
you normally talk to and they saw that

134
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:24,598
roughly half the time the individuals
routing the message choose the next node

135
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:29,433
to be on the shortest path and half the
time they goofed in away.

136
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:32,510
They, they didn't choose the shortest
path.

137
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,508
So.
Even for the successful chains they may

138
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:42,660
not actually lie on the shortest path.
So, six might be an overestimate.

139
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,489
Now, recently, there was a study done at
Facebook showing that any two Facebook

140
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:58,746
users are, you know, 4.7 hops apart. And
the question is, what, what does that

141
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:03,253
really mean?
You know, if you look at these different

142
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:07,984
social networking services, like Facebook,
like Twitter, like LinkedIn.

143
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:13,132
And I would definitely recommend listening
to the interview with LinkedIn,

144
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,142
Because this, this question is addressed
in there or, or Google+, you know?

145
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:23,708
What direct and indirect benefit do you
get from someone who's one hop away, two

146
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:28,300
hops, three hops, etcetera?
So just something for you to think about.
