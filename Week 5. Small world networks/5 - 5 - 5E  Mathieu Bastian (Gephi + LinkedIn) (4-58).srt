1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:03,333
Okay.
So here I am, still at LinkedIn and this

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:09,513
is Matthew Bastien who is the creator of
Geffey So the first question, is why did

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:13,124
you do it?
It's, it's, it's an interesting story

4
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:17,707
about my professor in 2007.
We had these large web graphs.

5
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:21,873
And there was really no tool to visualize
such large graphs.

6
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:25,857
So we just decided to create our own tool.
That's the story.

7
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:31,381
And then we had we had the, the Google of
seminar of code that brought a lot of

8
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,896
students, and passionate computer science
students.

9
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:38,286
To the project.
And that's, that's how I really started

10
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:41,111
then And became like a open source
community.

11
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:44,606
Yeah.
Yeah, so, so seems like it really is a,

12
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:50,186
community in that people who use Geffey
both kind of report back what their

13
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:54,457
results are; but they also create plugins
and, and other things.

14
00:00:54,457 --> 00:01:00,243
So what are the kind of the need either
examples of applications or plugins that

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,376
you think were especially like you, you
didn't anticipate?

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,165
Yes, I mean, plugins is one of our core
mission.

17
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:13,565
We try to have a tool that is extensible.
And that you know, like networks are

18
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:17,329
really everywhere.
You can have networks of software, code,

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,235
and networks of e-mails and social
networks.

20
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:25,650
So at the beginning we really knew that
there would be tons of other applications

21
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,215
for not just the core of network graphs
And so we knew that people would like to

22
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:35,470
extend Geffey for their particular
applications and, and data.

23
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:39,459
So that's why we created this modular
architecture.

24
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,910
And it really is interesting to, to see
people creating like, plug-ins to get

25
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:48,677
Like, networks, multi-modal networks or,
streaming.

26
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:52,972
So we had this great graph streaming plug
in that was created.

27
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:58,324
And you can basically see Geffe, having
data streamed live to it.

28
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,966
Mm hm.
And also streamed out of it.

29
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:04,732
So it became more like a platform to, to
monitor networks.

30
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:10,018
And that, that was really a breakthrough.
And there was this great example of the

31
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:15,462
Egyptian Revolution that Andre Panisson
recorded live when all the tweets were

32
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,432
coming in.
Hm.

33
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:19,463
And he saw this natural, construct on real
time.

34
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:24,252
That was really a breakthrough for, for
the [inaudible] and the community.

35
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:28,046
Okay.
We'll have to get a pointer to that to, to

36
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:33,207
share to students.
So I guess if it's not asking too much how

37
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:38,774
did you come to be at Linkedin and, and
how has social network analysis and, and

38
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:44,138
can perhaps Geffey in particular served
you in whatever you might be doing here.

39
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:45,293
[laugh].
Mm-hm.

40
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:50,046
Yes so I'm a data scientist here and we,
we looked at graphs a lot and.

41
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:53,576
But that, that's not the main reason why
I'm here.

42
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:56,640
I think.
One of the main reason is that, when you

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,751
work on, on, on graphs and practically in
Geffey you have a lot of interesting

44
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:07,602
challenges for a computer scientist.
And how do you store and retrieve you

45
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:11,572
know, large graph structure?
Or how do you visualize millions of

46
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:15,856
elements on a, on a screen?
How do you create an application that can

47
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:20,014
be executed in all the platforms?
You learn a lot by doing this.

48
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:26,776
So I learned a lot on well just by, by
coding basically and that's how I became

49
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:32,032
like more an expert in this area, and, and
that, that's how they got me.

50
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:32,986
Mm hm.
[laugh].

51
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:37,865
So if, if there is any, like, computer,
computer science students who is

52
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:41,343
interested in, in having some interesting
coding challenges.

53
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:44,708
We are, having a Google seminar of code
every year now.

54
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:49,251
And we are inviting students to, to
participate and just show their skills and

55
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:51,326
participate to the community.
Cool.

56
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:55,252
So we'll get a pointer to that as well,
and share it with the students.

57
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:58,393
So thanks for taking the time.
Thank you very much.
