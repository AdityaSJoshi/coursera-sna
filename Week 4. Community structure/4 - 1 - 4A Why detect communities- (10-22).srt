00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,059
Hi.
Welcome to week four of social network

2
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:06,627
analysis.
This week, we'll be looking at community

3
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:11,290
structure within the network.
First, we'll explain why community

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:16,165
structure is interesting.
Mostly it has to do with, instead of one

5
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:22,615
big hairball you have different regions
within the network that are interacting

6
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:26,061
with the,
Within that structure more then they are

7
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:30,455
with the rest of the network.
So, that's going to give you some

8
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:35,661
information about what is actually going
on besides, oh, my gosh, everything is

9
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,109
connected.
Next, we're going to look at different

10
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:44,585
definitions. How exactly do you define
that these set of nodes is a community as

11
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:47,830
opposed to this other set of nodes maybe
is not?

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:54,301
And finally, we're going to look at, you
know, given a network, how can you detect

13
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:25,378
the communities within it,
And how can you evaluate how good that

14
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:04,460
those extracted communities are, according
to some criteria.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,501
So first, why do we do it?
And I'll go through three separate

16
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,193
reasons.
The first is, well, these reasons are kind

17
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:18,016
of social network specific.
So, the first is, you can di, discover

18
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:22,386
communities of practice.
If you have communication between

19
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:28,565
individuals, discovering which groups of
individuals tend to communicate more with

20
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:33,960
each other can tell you what is the, the
structure of collaboration.

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,090
So, in a study at done at HP,
What they did was they took all the e-mail

22
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,720
communication,
Organically found water in the

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,754
communities.
And then, they compared it against the

24
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:53,320
actual reporting structure.
So here, grey is e-mail, and black is the

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,240
reporting structure.
And they found that in the vast majority

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,613
of cases, the different communities.
The communities just corresponded to the

27
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:09,474
actual reporting structure.
So, if people were, within the same unit

28
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:14,252
of the organization, they had similar
tasks, similar goals, and they tended to

29
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:18,338
collaborate with each other.
Okay, fine. This is a validation, right?

30
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:23,367
You only looked at e-mail communication
and you applied your community detection

31
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:26,825
algorithm and what was spat out was
totally reasonable.

32
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:30,471
You got the actual organization back,
which is informative.

33
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:35,500
You can imagine doing the same study in an
environment where there is no formal

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,278
organizational structure, but you still
want to know how did the individuals

35
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:43,082
organize together.
And this could tell you.

36
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:48,446
What was particularly interesting in this
study was that, there were a few

37
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:53,880
communities that were detected which
tended to cross different organizational

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,876
units.
And so, when the authors of the study,

39
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:02,300
Joshua Tyler, and, and others, went and
interviewed those individuals, what they

40
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,685
found was that they had tasks which, in
fact, bridged different parts of the

41
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:11,419
organization.
So, for example, printers with new

42
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,871
networking functionality.
Well, you needed the printer hardware

43
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:20,610
people, and you needed the, the people who
know about networking.

44
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:29,306
And, so the, the, in a way the community
detection was giving a more accurate

45
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:35,090
picture of the current collaboration
structure than you know, kind of the

46
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,808
formal organization which may or may not
have caught up later,

47
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:45,556
For example, by re-doing a re-org.
This next example is a very, very classic

48
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:50,641
example of the Zachary Karate Club.
This sociologist, Zachary, was studying

49
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:54,055
the interactions within a university
karate club.

50
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:58,931
And he said, oh, who do you talk to
regularly, who do you like, blah, blah,

51
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:01,369
blah.
And he got the social network.

52
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:07,221
Well, while he was studying that karate
club, there was a little bit of infighting

53
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:11,610
[LAUGH] with individuals in the club, and
the club split in two.

54
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,457
The question is, given who was talking to
whom and who liked whom, could you have

55
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,966
predicted which way the club was going to
split?

56
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:27,032
And if you can, this is kind of a test for
whether your community finding algorithm

57
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:30,687
is, is good or not.
Then, you know, that's, that's useful.

58
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:36,315
Imagine if you can look at any social
network and you can say, well, if things

59
00:04:36,315 --> 00:04:41,140
get tough, I think this, this subset is
going to go so that, that seems useful.

60
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,443
This next example is taken from the book
it's actually kinda a Pajek manual that

61
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:52,889
teaches you a lot of social network
analysis as well,

62
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:58,762
It's called Exploratory Social Network
Analysis with Pajek. And, in this

63
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:04,131
particular data set, which I've now
remapped with, with Geffy, you have

64
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,830
workers at a sawmill.
That is, they're processing wood.

65
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,016
And they're different kinds.
So, here you have the management,

66
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:19,807
You have English speaking workers they're,
they're marked with E.

67
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:26,808
And then, you have different roles, so the
Y's work in the yard the P's are the

68
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:33,584
planers and the M's are the millers.
And, the, what happens was that the

69
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:41,055
management wanted to introduce a new plan.
and they thought that everybody would be

70
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:45,468
on board because it was supposed to be
beneficial all around.

71
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:50,749
What they found instead was that, there
was a lot of resistance with, from

72
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:55,813
actually the Hispanic workers.
They called in a sociologist who mapped,

73
00:05:55,813 --> 00:06:01,600
who talked to whom frequently, and after
mapping everything out said, I think you

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,579
should talk to Juan.
They, the management talked to Juan,

75
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:09,920
explained the plan, Juan said, I, I will
talk to my friends.

76
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,305
Next day, practically, everyone was on
board with the plan.

77
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:19,999
So, the quiz is, why did this happen?
What is it about the structure of this

78
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:26,266
network that would have told you that
talking to Juan is the correct answer?

79
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:31,868
The correct thing to do.
In this final example of the usefulness of

80
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:37,720
community finding in social networks,
we'll look at opinion formations.

81
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,819
So, what I'd like you to do is to actually
go to this link.

82
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,361
And let's see if I can find it as well.
Hopefully, hopefully.

83
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:51,085
Okay.
So, here, you have two choices.

84
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:55,970
You can either create a network that has
community structure,

85
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,057
And you can lay it out a little bit more
so it's more clear, or you can turn

86
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:06,521
community structure off.
So, I'm going to create an Erdos-Renyi

87
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:11,313
graph instead, and then you can do
something called Update Opinion.

88
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:17,267
And, what happens is that each node looks
at two of its neighbors, and in this case,

89
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:21,333
it's changed its opinion it's, it's turned
into a square.

90
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:27,544
And, what it does is, if a majority of its
neighbors have say the red opinion, it

91
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:31,090
will switch to red if it isn't red
already.

92
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:38,264
If it's equal numbers of red versus blue,
it will just flip a coin and it may switch

93
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:42,799
or it may not.
So, I'd like you to do this repeatedly for

94
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:48,490
the Erdos-Renyi and the two communities
and see in which case the,

95
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,573
You can have divergent opinions persist in
the network in the long run.

96
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:59,229
That is, you do a lot of updates of the
opinion and sometimes, though not always,

97
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:04,098
different parts of the network will
maintain a different opinion.

98
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:07,677
So, let's try and go back to PowerPoint.
Excellent.

99
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:12,260
Okay. So, this is your quiz question which
I'd like you to answer.

100
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:24,437
So, hopefully what you saw was that the,
When you have two separate communities,

101
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:30,628
Because individuals can have more ties
within the community than outside of the

102
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:33,491
community,
They can actually, you know,

103
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:39,450
They're seeing like-minded individuals.
And, they can persist in their opinion

104
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,331
even if, say, the rest of the network is
thinking something else. They, they're

105
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:51,522
just not evenly mixed enough such that
they would be influenced and the opinion

106
00:08:51,522 --> 00:09:02,078
would propagate throughout the network.
So, in this final example, it's a high

107
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:07,956
resolution map of science that the
researchers did in a very clever way.

108
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:14,305
They looked at access patterns in online
repositories of scientific articles, for

109
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:18,616
example, JSTOR,
Or actually, it's scholarly articles. The

110
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:25,434
JSTOR has a lot of humanities and social
sciences and natural sciences. It's mostly

111
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:30,755
on the biology end of things.
And what they did was they looked at, if

112
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:36,872
you access an article in this area, what
other areas are you likely to be exploring

113
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:42,178
within the same browsing session.
And, if we look a little bit in greater

114
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:47,632
detail, you can see things, for example,
plant biology being closely tied to

115
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:51,390
ecology and biodiversity and environmental
science.

116
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,447
And what's more,
You can then collapse these different

117
00:09:55,447 --> 00:10:01,580
communities into metanodes, and see how
the metanodes are then themselves related

118
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,972
to each other.
So, pretty neat, applications of community

119
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:11,499
finding. And, in the next segment, we'll
get to the more difficult wor, work,

120
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:17,405
although still fun, of trying to define
what exactly are these communities. And

121
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:22,706
then, in the third segment, we'll look at
how do you actually find them.
