00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
As we part, I'd like to congratulate you
for sticking with this course throughout

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,040
its eight weeks.
I hope that you have a good sense about

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,822
networks.
What I, what I hope you got out of it is

4
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:20,862
understanding what are the key properties
of empirically observed networks, what are

5
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:26,973
the processes that shape them that help us
to understand what those empirical numbers

6
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:32,582
mean, and what implications this has for
various functions that the network is

7
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:37,543
supposed to be carrying out.
For example, whether it's enabling people

8
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:41,570
to communicate or to search and, and find
one another,

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:47,960
Or, you know, some of the cool and unusual
applications where the nodes might be

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,350
different products in a product space that
different countries participate and

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,143
compete in.
At the same time, we've in a sense just

12
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:04,471
scratched the surface of all of the
wonderful research and learning that you

13
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:09,513
can do in this area.
One thing that I haven't covered at all

14
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:16,371
are biological networks and this is one of
the largest application areas with many

15
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:22,734
fascinating findings, ranging from
understanding how different functions have

16
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:28,270
evolved to how cells work to I mean, it
just goes on and on.

17
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,650
It's, it's really,
I mean, things like the relationship

18
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:40,137
between genetics and disease, all of this
now is heavily influenced by our

19
00:01:40,137 --> 00:01:44,910
understanding of how things are networked
together.

20
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:50,623
Similarly, there's so many other
application areas that we haven't, that

21
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:55,772
you wouldn't even imagine.
For example, network analysis of space

22
00:01:55,772 --> 00:02:01,888
that architects use to understand which
spaces are going to be conducive to

23
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:08,566
individuals flowing through, which spaces
are going to allow them to communicate.

24
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:15,659
Just things of that sort.
We also have not used some of the tools

25
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:22,072
that are heavily used in some domains.
So, for example, there is a most excellent

26
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:29,226
book by Mark Newman, who's also faculty at
the University of Michigan, called

27
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:35,887
Introduction to Networks and, it's really
a tome, it's a, it's a very thick book,

28
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:42,794
where he shows you how using, you know,
some heavy-duty math and analytics you can

29
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:50,217
derive many network properties from
knowledge of simple things such as the

30
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:55,139
degree distribution.
So you can actually derive what the size

31
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,595
of the giant component will be given the
degree distribution of the network, for

32
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:05,145
example.
It also looks a lot at different

33
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:10,797
algorithms for detecting community
structure and really grounds such

34
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:17,918
approaches on, you know, kind of, in a, in
a statistical way where you're looking at

35
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:24,393
ensembles of many different network
instantiations and looking at whether what

36
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:30,786
you observe is actually significantly
different from what you would see at

37
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:34,594
random.
On the economic side of things, Matthew

38
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:41,064
Jackson, who's faculty at Stanford, has
written an excellent book Social and

39
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:46,040
Economic Networks,
And things that we really didn't get into

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,758
that much are, but that the book covers,
are things like, what strategically, if

41
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:59,560
you have, if the nodes are self-interested
and maximizing the utility that they get

42
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,252
from the network,
How will the network be wired?

43
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:08,960
Or if you're playing certain games,
I mean we did this simple cascade model

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,602
but what if you were playing prisoner's
dilemma on a network.

45
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:17,330
.
How does the network topology affect the

46
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,624
outcomes?
.

47
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:25,853
Then Laszlo Barabasi and his collaborators
are writing more chapters of the wonderful

48
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:31,271
Network Science Book,
That which is aimed more at, at a beginner

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:37,985
audience. So I think you would you could
probably understand, no matter your, your

50
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:44,699
background, a great portion of that book.
So other topics that we didn't get to this

51
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,602
time around, include how networks evolve
over time.

52
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:55,160
So, Gephi actually has some functionality
for visualizing how networks evolve.

53
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:59,220
But questions that you might be interested
in is,

54
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,450
Does the community structure teach?
Does the network densify that is this will

55
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:10,003
become denser over time?
You can track centralities,

56
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:16,793
So are there different nodes that emerge
as being important during different time

57
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:20,548
periods.
So that's a whole area, which, it's sort

58
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:25,900
of easy to extrapolate from where we are
now to doing it over time.

59
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,130
But, I'm just sorry, I didn't get a chance
to do that with you this time around.

60
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,018
So,
No, another very fruitful part are these

61
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:44,225
p-star models where you statistically
determine factors that are affecting

62
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:50,498
network formations, so rather than saying
oh, okay it's going, it'll, it's going to

63
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:54,653
have this probability of preferential
attachment,

64
00:05:54,653 --> 00:06:01,510
You're going to actually run an analysis
that's going to extract that from the

65
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,051
observed data.
You know, is the network going

66
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:10,363
preferentially or not?
Is triadic closure a large factor in how

67
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:15,353
this network has formed?
And finally, you know, cool and unusual

68
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:19,700
applications, they're happening every day
all the time,

69
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,497
Whether you want to understand what's
happening in politics,

70
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,763
In, education.
[laugh].

71
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:34,395
Really, there, there's no limit to where
you can apply, network analysis.

72
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:41,447
So I do hope you, have found this class
useful and that now you will go forth and

73
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:46,568
apply social network analysis to whatever
might interest you.

74
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:50,850
So, thanks for sticking with me through
these weeks.
