1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
But the question might be, is it really
that simple?

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,994
Is it just that you can map out the
network, figure out which nodes to target,

3
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:13,852
and you're done.
Well, when some very smart physicist

4
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:20,335
started doing this on, for example, the
physical topology of the Internet,

5
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:27,539
computer scientists didn't really take it
that seriously because they said, well,

6
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,063
it's,
You know, how these ISPs or how these

7
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:37,697
different nodes are connected, is dynamic.
So you have routing tables and depending

8
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:44,734
on you know, where the packets are getting
through and where they're not, the routing

9
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:50,397
tables are continuously updated.
So you could in fact, inflict what you

10
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:56,787
think is a lot of damage and the, the
network simply organically adapts to what

11
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,810
is going on.
Similarly,

12
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,462
You know, it would be nice,
Ideally, you map out a terrorist network

13
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:10,852
or a criminal network, for example,
individuals involved in the drug trade.

14
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:17,569
However, there was recently a report, you
know, the ten year long effort by the US

15
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:24,533
to target you know, exactly this kind of
drug trade network and, they found that no

16
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:30,841
matter how many of those nodes they
removed by incarcerating them, sending

17
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,452
them to prison,
The network adapted,

18
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:36,630
Just new people came in and filled that
space.

19
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,159
So, it's not that the network is sitting
there and saying, oh, okay, I lost this

20
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,130
node, I'm not going to do anything about
it.

21
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,452
They're, they're very dynamic and, so,
yes, you know, perhaps during a short time

22
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:56,256
period, if you can simultaneously take out
a lot of the nodes, and the network has no

23
00:01:56,256 --> 00:02:01,509
way of replacing them, then you can
predict, you know, that you're going to be

24
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:06,070
able to break up the network into small
non, non-functioning parts.

25
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,072
But, in general,
You know, you have to be careful about

26
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:13,616
this,
This particular assumption, what power you

27
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:19,474
have to bring the network down.
So let's look at a particular example and

28
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:24,361
not as of the power grid.
Here again, there you know we're going to

29
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:29,744
dismiss some assumptions that we had with
other networks and we're going to

30
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:32,790
introduce some new simplifying
assumptions.

31
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,198
Here, what we're talking about is that
where the electricity is produced, is not

32
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:45,606
always where it is consumed and you need
intermediate distribution actually

33
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:52,339
transmission stations that will bring the
power from the generators to the kind of

34
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:58,098
the end distribution stations that then
deliver the electricity locally to

35
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:01,586
customers.
And, as you probably are aware,

36
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,998
Failures of the power grid can be quite
dramatic.

37
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:12,573
So, if you have a power plant, go down in,
or, or one station go down in, at, at one

38
00:03:12,573 --> 00:03:16,341
location,
You can get what's called a cascading

39
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:19,788
failure,
Where, you know, entire spots of the

40
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:24,278
country will be without power,
Because this is a network,

41
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:30,514
And what happens at one node, actually
influences what happens at, you know, to

42
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,847
the other nodes.
So, in a way, the, here the damage is

43
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,723
greater.
It's not that removing one node, now

44
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:42,213
you've lost the paths that go through that
node, and the edges involved, with that

45
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:45,760
node.
Because electricity flows, you know,

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,857
basically simultaneously through all
possible paths one removal of one node

47
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:59,311
actually effects all of the, all of the
net, the rest of the network to a greater

48
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:03,557
or lesser extent.
So let's see how that happens.

49
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:09,586
What happens is that, when a node goes
out, it will have some load and a

50
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:16,294
capacity, and say that the load exceeds
the capacity, the, the node will fail, and

51
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:20,880
now its load is redistributed around to
its neighbors.

52
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:29,324
So I'll just follow this paper by Kinney
et al and this is Reka Albert from the

53
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:32,972
Barabasi-Albert model who's on this paper
as well.

54
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:38,174
So again the node's are generators,
transmission substations, and distribution

55
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:42,363
substations and the edges are high voltage
transmission lines.

56
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:46,957
And there basically thousands of these
nodes and about 20,000 edges.

57
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,085
So.
What happens?

58
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:51,288
Well, first of all, use see this straight
line?

59
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:55,417
You might think, oh, that's a power lot.
Well, no, it's not.

60
00:04:55,417 --> 00:05:01,693
Actually, the power grid is an exponential
network and you can tell because this is a

61
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:07,766
linear axis and this is logarithmic. And
so that means that there aren't really

62
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:13,608
these huge hubs, Right? The highest degree
node has fewer than 25 connections,

63
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:19,220
Which kind of makes sense. Ccan you really
imagine, one, you know, one of these

64
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,909
transmission stations being wired to a
thousand others, right?

65
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:29,982
You just can't really imagine this
topology of, of high voltage wires really,

66
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:33,980
really doing that,
So we have an exponential network.

67
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,497
And now we need to know, where is the
electricity flowing?

68
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:42,380
So, it's not just that it flows through
all paths.

69
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,436
So we're going to see which,
Where, which paths is it really flowing

70
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:52,818
through, depending on their capacity.
And so, we're going to have certain

71
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:56,091
efficiency of the edge, and we can
compare,

72
00:05:56,091 --> 00:06:01,910
And then we have efficiency of the path
that is composed of a bunch of these

73
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,401
edges.
And the simplifying assumption in the end

74
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:10,711
is that we're going to assume it only goes
along the most efficient path.

75
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:16,457
But in practice, it actually goes through
all of them, but primarily through the

76
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,130
high efficiency one.
So,

77
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,243
We, we can compare three different paths.
Path A has two edges, and each of those

78
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:28,802
edges has efficiency 0.5, which gives the
efficiency of the path of one-fourth.

79
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:34,116
Path B has three edges, each with
efficiency 0.5, which gives the efficiency

80
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:38,259
of the path as one-sixth.
And then, path C has two edges, one with

81
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:43,178
efficiency zero and the other with
efficiency one, and the efficiency of the

82
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:48,678
whole path is zero, because if part of the
path lets no electricity through, then,

83
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:54,634
you know that path lets no electricity
through. And it's nice that you, instead

84
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:59,428
of, you know, averaging these
efficiencies, we have that the shorter

85
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:02,950
path is more, is more efficient.
So,

86
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,079
We can then look at the efficiency of the
overall network.

87
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:13,130
And we're going to just look at all the
paths between all the generating stations

88
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,405
and all the kind of end distribution
stations.

89
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:22,528
And we're going to look at the efficiency
of the most efficient path between i and

90
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:25,660
j,
And that's how we'll measure how well the

91
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,790
network as a whole is doing in delivering
the electricity.

92
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:35,988
What we're also going to say is that the
capacity of each node is proportional to

93
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:42,337
its initial load times alpha, and you want
alpha to be greater than one, because you

94
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:48,460
want its capacity, capacity to be greater
than its initial load. And then what's

95
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,200
going to happen as the dynamics unfold, is
that if the load is less than the

96
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,895
capacity, then the neighbors are
unaffected, right?

97
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:04,154
The node is functioning as usual and the
neighbors are just carrying whatever they

98
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:09,375
would normally be carrying.
However, if the load of this node exceeds

99
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:13,444
the nodes capacity, then that node shuts
down temporarily.

100
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:18,513
As, as long as the capacity,
As long as the node exceeds the capacity,

101
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:24,081
it will be in a degraded, degraded state
and instead, its neighbors are going to

102
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:31,276
have to carry some of the load, which is
going to degrade their, their efficiency

103
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:36,577
by this factor, which is how much, the
original node was overloaded.

104
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:42,569
And so, this is kind of this distribution
which then can produce the cascading

105
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:46,333
failure.
One node exceeding its capacity now puts

106
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:52,556
that, load on its neighbors, who in turn
can fail and those nodes in turn might,

107
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:57,320
you know, then distribute their load to
their neighbors, etcetera.

108
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:06,003
And what in this paper, they measured
simulating, but on the real topology is

109
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:12,269
what happens if you just remove nodes at,
at random.

110
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,765
[laugh].
So, you just assume one, one or more of

111
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:25,790
them are failed for some reason,
And this is as you target.

112
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,679
You know, you get to pick which one fails
and you can see that this is this is

113
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,131
worse, because the network efficiency
drops down further and this is random.

114
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,408
And, here is the overload tolerance.
So, just look at this fgure closely and

115
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:49,712
see what you can conclude about the
network efficiency as a function of this

116
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:53,970
overload tolerance that you've given to
the network.

117
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:00,341
So specifically the quiz question is how
much higher would the capacity the average

118
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:06,333
capacity of each node need to be relative
to the initial load in order for the

119
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:12,705
network to be basically unaffected by the
removal either targeted removal of a node

120
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:16,270
or a random a random failure of such a
node.

121
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,785
So hopefully, what you saw was that,
increasing the average capacity just 30%

122
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:29,386
or 40% above the typical load, what we
call the initial load, would render the

123
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:33,817
network com.
You know, relatively safe to the random

124
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:37,900
and even targeted failure of a particular
node.

125
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,818
Now, why do or why did in the past these
cascading failures occur?

126
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:48,494
Well, that was because power companies had
little incentive to provide this

127
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:54,018
additional capacity. Aall right?
Because they were kind of charging for the

128
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:59,391
load they were carrying, not for
additional capacity they could provide,

129
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:04,159
which would kick in, in situations where
there were failures.

130
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:10,137
But, you know, research such as this can
show that, that additional capacity need

131
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:16,456
not be that large and it would still
render the, the network pretty resilient

132
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,739
to failure.
Now, to recap.

133
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:22,890
We saw that resilience really depends on
topology.

134
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,457
And this was, you know, not just the
degree distribution,

135
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:34,266
Which then rendered the network, say, more
resilient to random attack if there were,

136
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:41,074
if the degree distribution was skewed,
But less resilient to targeted attack, in

137
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:45,309
that case.
But, it also depends on what happens when

138
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,800
a node fails.
It could be that,

139
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,755
That's it, just a node fails, but all the
other nodes are unaffected, or it can have

140
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:58,549
this cascading effect, for example, what
we see with the power grid,

141
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:04,359
Or it can have the opposite effect, which
is what we saw with, say, crime networks,

142
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:09,588
where the node is quickly replaced.
In fact, someone was probably eagerly

143
