1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,962
So far we have treated the degree
distribution of the network as the most

2
00:00:05,962 --> 00:00:10,877
important factor in how resilient the
network is going to be.

3
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:16,920
But we've paid no attention to how those
nodes are actually wired together.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,718
And, one simple way of capturing who is
wired to whom is to who is to look at

5
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:26,558
assortativity.
Specifically degree of assortativity.

6
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:32,583
In general, assortativity could just mean,
whether like nodes associate with like.

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:37,930
When we're talking about degree
assortativity, we're looking at whether

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,926
nodes who are social have lots of
connections, are connected to other nodes

9
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:47,524
who are likewise social, or is it the
reverse?

10
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:54,001
Is it that the hobs are associated with
the hermits? The people who have very few

11
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,400
connections?
And, if we look at.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,931
Different kinds of networks.
Here's an example of an assortative

13
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:06,595
network where you have the hobs connecting
to the other hobs, and the low-degree

14
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:09,640
nodes connecting to other low-degree
nodes.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,516
Here perhaps this topology is random, it
reminds you of when we grew a preferential

16
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:19,623
attachment network.
And here, the network is disassortative,

17
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:25,500
so the hobs like the low-degree nodes and
Yeah, that's the, basically captures it.

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,655
There are different ways in which you can
capture this and one is to actually

19
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:36,143
enumerate all possible pairings of degrees
across the edges.

20
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:41,828
And look at the same property in a
randomized network to see, and the reason

21
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:47,364
why it randomizes is just to see.
You know, sometimes at random, you'll have

22
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:51,180
a high degree node connecting to a low
degree node.

23
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:57,320
So if you were to do this for the
internet, here's what you would see.

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,780
You would see that these medium hubs, and
you know, there, having 30 connections is

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,326
not that medium.
Tend to be connected with relatively low

26
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:12,871
degree nodes.
And the low degree nodes actually end up

27
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:19,411
being connected with even the, the highest
hubs versus the highest hubs tend to be

28
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:25,940
connected either with low degree nodes or
with other, you know, very high degree

29
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,755
hubs.
So it gives you a more rich representation

30
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:35,046
of who is connecting to whom.
You can simplify this, right?

31
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:39,217
This is a two a 2D histogram, in, in
essence.

32
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:44,266
Almost a 3D plot, right?
The, the coloring was the third dimension.

33
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:49,709
We can reduce this to a 2D plot if we look
at the degree of the node.

34
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,890
And then look at the average degree of the
neighbors.

35
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,519
And in fact it, it gives you extra
sensitivity.

36
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,199
Do you remember how I said, you can test
your models by doing additional

37
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,301
measurements?
Well, here is an additional measurement

38
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:13,968
that, in fact, the regular Barabasi Albert
preferential attachment model, it fails.

39
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:20,342
It has no trend in the average degree of
the neighbor as a function of the degree

40
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:23,866
of the node.
In fact, if we look at the physical

41
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:30,494
Internet. it says that the average degree
of the neighbor falls the higher the

42
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:37,560
degree of the node and so.
It wasn't until the fitness model which

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,392
you know hm, can be just a year later,
within a year where the probability that a

44
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:48,562
node get one of those new edges associated
with a new node .

45
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:53,798
It depends, not just on the degree of the
node, but also on its inherent fitness

46
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:58,902
that you get this kind of relationship
with, which is much closer to what you

47
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:02,812
observe in real life.
And, there's a, I don't know if you can

48
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:07,850
hear the crow but it wants to chime in on
this presentation as well.

49
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,494
And then, to simplify even more, you can
just look at a single number, which is

50
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:17,966
over all the edges.
You just take the correlation between the

51
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:23,538
degrees of the nodes on either side.
So, for example, for the Internet, you get

52
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:28,743
this slight disassortativity of minus two.
And of course, you do lose some

53
00:04:28,743 --> 00:04:32,262
information.
For example, yes, you know, on average,

54
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:38,420
the network is disassortative, but we also
saw that for the highest degree nodes, you

55
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,968
know there was,
They were actually likely to both be

56
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:47,195
connected to each other and to the very
low degree nodes and it was the middle

57
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:51,562
that was the, the missing chunk.
Still, it's nice to just be able to

58
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,738
characterize this property with a single
number.

59
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:59,436
So if you'd like a simple, single number,
then you can just look at this

60
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:03,130
correlation.
I mentioned that you can talk about

61
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,496
assortative mixing more generally, so if
you were talking about social ties, you

62
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:13,767
may be looking at race and income and
gender and age.

63
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:21,502
You can look at food webs herbivores and,
and carnivores I mean I, I'm assuming in

64
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:26,498
the, in the food web it might be a bit
disassortative there.

65
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,780
And we already discussed the, the.
Internet in terms of the degree but maybe

66
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:40,101
really what is the property that they're
really connecting on is the type of node

67
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:45,700
that they are, whether they're high level
connectivity providers, internet service

68
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,612
providers, or consumers.
And in general, when you're talking about

69
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:57,257
social networks, you you're talking about
homophily the term birds of a feather

70
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:04,227
flock together is saying exactly this that
individuals in some scenarios will tend to

71
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:09,900
associate on observable characteristics
for example age and gender.

72
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,904
To check our understanding, will a network
with positive or negative degrees

73
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:24,656
sortativity be more resilient to attack?
And for this, let's go to Netlogo, and

74
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:31,759
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set
up a topology, and this network is going

75
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,985
to be disassorted, that is, the
high-degree nodes are going to be

76
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:42,786
connected to the low-degree nodes.
And the way that I did this was by taking

77
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:46,603
the originally grown network, and then
rewiring it.

78
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:52,405
And, the rewiring is accepted if it, in
this case, decreases assortativity, and

79
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:57,061
not accepted otherwise.
So, let's, let's try and attack this.

80
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:03,397
And the way that we're going to attack it
is we're going to select the ten highest

81
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:07,868
degree nodes.
And we observe what happens to the

82
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:12,440
network.
Now let's grow an assortative network.

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,402
And you should see the high degree nodes
clumping together.

84
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:26,429
And the low degree nodes being pushed out
to the periphery.

85
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:33,671
And hopefully it will finish rewiring soon
but that's not, well you see this dense

86
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:37,932
central core.
Now we're going to attack and we can

87
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:42,959
observe what happens.
And, and here the, the red nodes are in

88
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,560
the giant component.
So going back to our presentation.

89
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:58,691
Hopefully what you saw was that in the
case of assortative mixing there was very

90
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:04,014
little impact.
You know, we disconnected these parts of

91
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:11,117
the network, but in general there was so
much redundancy in that central core that

92
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:18,047
we didn't end up breaking up the network.
This is sort of the case however, the, a

93
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:24,890
lot of these nodes are connected to, just
to the hubs and so once the hubs were

94
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,922
removed, the, The network was pretty much
broken up with the removal of just ten
